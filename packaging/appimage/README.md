# Linux AppImage

Download `tesktop2-<version>-Linux-X64.AppImage` from
[Releases](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/rustcord/releases), keep it in a writable
directory, and make it executable:

```sh
chmod +x ./tesktop2-<version>-Linux-X64.AppImage
./tesktop2-<version>-Linux-X64.AppImage
```

The x86_64 image contains tesktop2 including voice, its desktop entry, icon and
application licenses. It uses **host runtime libraries**, including GTK4 and
WebKitGTK 6.0; it is not a self-contained distribution of those libraries. Release
builds use Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39), so systems with an older glibc or incompatible
native library versions are not supported by this artifact. Use the distribution
packages or Flatpak where their supported runtime is a better match.

On Ubuntu 24.04, install the runtime dependencies once:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libwebkitgtk-6.0-4 libasound2t64 libfontconfig1 \
  libgstreamer1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 \
  libvulkan1 libegl1 libxkbcommon0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 \
  libwayland-client0 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcursor1 libxi6 libxrandr2 \
  dbus-user-session xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-keyring \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good libpulse0 gstreamer1.0-libav \
  gstreamer1.0-pipewire gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-gl
```

The WebKitGTK package supplies its matching browser subprocesses, data files and
GTK dependencies. tesktop2 does not relocate or patch WebKit, disable its sandbox,
or override the host library search path. A graphical session, graphics driver,
portal backend and unlocked Secret Service provider are still required. A KDE
portal/keyring provider can replace the GNOME choices above. No library or desktop
service is installed by launching the AppImage.

The embedded runtime includes FUSE support without requiring the old `libfuse2`
package. Systems that cannot mount AppImages can run:

```sh
./tesktop2-<version>-Linux-X64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run
```

Settings → Updates uses the same Production/Nightly channels and automatic-download
preference as Windows/macOS. Restart applies a checked download to the original
AppImage filename. Both the file and its directory must be writable, and the
filesystem must support hard links for the rollback copy (for example ext4 or
Btrfs; FAT/exFAT require manual replacement). An extracted
`squashfs-root/AppRun` and native/Flatpak installations use manual or package-manager
updates. Keep the outer AppImage file in place while tesktop2 is running.

New AppImages embed the standard `gh-releases-zsync` update information and ship
with a matching `.AppImage.zsync` release asset. Compatible tools such as
[AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) can reuse
unchanged blocks from your existing image, reducing update downloads. Production
images track `latest`; prerelease images track `latest-pre`. This follows the
[AppImage update specification](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageSpec/blob/master/draft.md#github-releases).
tesktop2's Settings → Updates also reuses local blocks when the selected release has
a verified `.zsync` asset. It uses the selected Production/Nightly channel and
checks the reconstructed image against the release SHA-256 before staging it.
Missing or incompatible metadata, unsupported HTTP ranges, or failed reconstruction
automatically fall back to a full download. No external updater needs to be installed.
Its channel setting does not change the channel embedded for external update tools.
Older images without update information need a full download once to gain external
update support.

## Build and pipeline

On the Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 build host, first install the existing
[native build dependencies](../linux/README.md), then:

```sh
sudo apt install zsync
bash packaging/appimage/install-tools.sh
cargo xtask package --format appimage
```

The installer downloads [appimagetool 1.9.1](https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool/releases/tag/1.9.1)
and [Type 2 runtime 20251108](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/releases/tag/20251108),
verifying each against its pinned SHA-256 before use. The packager reuses the native
payload allowlist, rejects unresolved host libraries, verifies the output's Type 2
x86_64 header, and extracts it to compare packaged file contents and executable
permissions. It never starts tesktop2 or opens a session. Packages over the updater's
512 MiB limit fail the build. Runtime sources and build instructions are available
at the pinned runtime release; its license and third-party notices are included.
The runtime statically links third-party components including LGPL libfuse; its
[exact source revision](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/tree/dd6cebedcbddde9c82f89b011e8e1d40b6e43868)
and [build/relink instructions](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/blob/dd6cebedcbddde9c82f89b011e8e1d40b6e43868/BUILD.md)
identify the build recipes and dependency sources. A replacement runtime can be
supplied to appimagetool with `--runtime-file`. These references preserve upstream
source/relink information; this fast pass does not certify redistribution license
coverage. License review remains in the dedicated license CI workflow.

The Ubuntu 24.04 job in `linux-packages.yml` builds the AppImage separately from
the Ubuntu 26.04 `.deb`, then uploads the image and its `.zsync` sidecar. Both are
included in release checksums. The packager verifies the embedded update information
and requires a nonempty sidecar. Local artifacts use the workspace version; CI sets
`TESKTOP2_RELEASE_TAG=v<version>` so both artifacts use their final published names
before zsync generation. The sidecar points to the absolute, versioned GitHub asset
URL. Release publication is not performed by local packaging.

AppImage packaging, Linux desktop startup, live authentication/audio and an actual
release-to-release AppImage upgrade remain unverified by the initial fast local pass.
