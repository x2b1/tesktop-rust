# Notification sounds

The `discord/` files are byte-original assets downloaded September 21, 2026 from
Discord's public asset host. Symbolic names were verified in the public
[app bundle](https://discord.com/assets/web.9a6d63589ff469f3.js).
They are 44.1 kHz stereo MP3s, each below 128 KiB and six seconds. Playback converts
from the source sample rate; no re-encoding, metadata stripping or trimming is applied.

leaving enough time for each complete clip before its next playback.
