# Compiled legacy SDK fixture

This preserves the App Toolbox binary from before message-details/relationships
and later channel-metadata/member-details additions. Its original manifest and
strict event vocabulary remain unchanged. `legacy_sdk_check` runs synthetic
foreground and app-data inputs through the current real Wasm sandbox, then
checks that newer event kinds are rejected by the original manifest before
execution. It does not exercise enable/disable, reload, install or account
lifecycle behavior and does not establish live Discord compatibility.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --locked --release -p extensions --example legacy_sdk_check
```
