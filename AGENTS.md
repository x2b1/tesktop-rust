# tesktop2 — idea to pull request

## Product boundaries

Read the documentation completely before changing scope. This is an unofficial native client for
existing Discord accounts, never a backend, bot replacement or Electron/web messaging wrapper.
Preserve unrelated work. More specific `AGENTS.md` files apply inside their subtrees.

- Rust + egui/eframe; voice ships in every build without a feature flag. Keep media work isolated from rendering.
- Local bounded SQLite caches, drafts, settings and diagnostics are allowed. Bound all caches,
  payloads and queues by bytes as well as items; do expensive work outside rendering/audio callbacks.
- Saved tokens belong only in the OS credential store, never a plaintext fallback. Keep active
  secrets redacted in memory. Official login may use an ephemeral authentication-only webview.
  User-solved invite CAPTCHAs may use a temporary verification-only webview with a
  service-supplied public sitekey and bounded, session-only passcode handoff.
- No credential extraction from other applications, challenge bypass, telemetry, unbounded logs,
  backend, account system, relay or separate voice infrastructure.
- Default tests and screenshots use synthetic/offline data. Live tests require the owner to
  explicitly enable the developer-session build and control the private conversation. Never ask
  for credentials in chat. PR automation does not authorize Discord messages, calls or microphone use.
- Distinguish documented, restricted, unofficial and unverified protocol behavior. A fixture,
  screenshot, successful build or bot session is never proof of a working Discord client.

## Default delivery contract

The owner wants to describe an idea and receive an implemented pull request. Treat feature/fix
requests as authorization to implement, test, build locally, capture synthetic native screenshots,
measure relevant performance, create a task branch, commit task files, push to the existing `origin`
and open/update its PR. Do not stop at a plan or ask again for those routine steps.

Read [the delivery skill](.agents/skills/tesktop2-delivery/SKILL.md) for implementation tasks.
This is a workflow for an active coding session, not a background daemon or a fixed delivery-time
promise. Build times, platform access, credentials and CI can delay completion.

## Fast local mode

When a request begins with `!fast`, it authorizes a local, uncommitted implementation pass. Write
the requested code and run only the smallest debug command that exercises it. Skip baselines,
`cargo xtask check`, focused tests, packages, screenshots, performance/size measurements,
commits, pushes, and PR work. Do not start external or live-account
actions. If the debug run cannot be performed, state the concrete blocker.

Finish with `Done — please check it. Say confirm to commit and push it to main.` On an explicit
confirmation, check formatting and linting before committing or pushing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo fmt --manifest-path fuzz/Cargo.toml --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
```

Fix formatting/lint failures and rerun these checks until all pass, preserving unrelated
uncommitted work. If a check cannot pass, report the blocker and do not push. Review and commit
only the fast-task paths and required formatting/lint fixes, then push `main`; do not create a PR
unless separately requested. This mode never waives security, input validation, secret handling,
or the product boundaries above.

1. Inspect the relevant implementation, callers and tests. Establish the baseline before edits.
2. Make reasonable reversible choices and implement a complete useful slice. Ask only when missing
   information changes scope materially or an action exceeds the authorization above; continue
   independent work while waiting.
3. Use the smallest existing mechanism that works. No speculative layers, dependencies or tests
   of source-file wording. Reuse design tokens in `crates/ui/src/design.rs` and existing widgets.
4. Delegate bounded independent implementation/review tasks when useful; assign separate file
   ownership. Do not spawn agents for work faster to do directly. Review their changes yourself.
5. Verify behavior, inspect the diff, record real evidence, then deliver the PR. Never merge,
   publish a release, deploy, force-push or change repository permissions without a separate request.

## Repository map and commands

- `crates/model`, `discord-protocol`: typed entities, bounded wire parsing, absent/null patches.
- `crates/client-core`, `session-cache`: state owner, reconciliation, generations and bounded RAM.
- `crates/discord-api`, `discord-gateway`, `discord-voice`: service transports; no raw network logic in UI.
- `crates/local-store`, `platform`: account-isolated persistence and native integrations.
- `crates/ui`, `apps/desktop`: native widgets and application wiring.
- `crates/test-support`, `tools/replay-bench`: explicitly synthetic fixtures and replay workloads.

```bash
cargo xtask check                       # format, workspace tests, strict Clippy, policy checks
node tests/login-handoff.cjs            # synthetic authentication bridge checks
cargo replay                           # release reducer workload; not RSS or UI frame timing
cargo run --locked -p tesktop2 -- --demo  # native offline UI; never omit --demo for agent screenshots
cargo xtask package                    # host package, including voice
```

Use the pinned toolchain and lockfile. Inspect actual dependency APIs/features before changing them.
Run focused behavioral tests while developing, then `cargo xtask check` before delivery. Run the
handoff check when authentication changes. Build the standard release package for runtime changes, including voice. Preserve licenses/notices.
For instructions/templates-only work, run skill validation and diff review as well; no new test
suite or native screenshots are needed for an unchanged application.

## Git and review

- Start with `git status --short`, branch/upstream inspection and `git fetch origin`. Discover the
  remote default branch; do not assume or switch another person's current task branch.
- From a clean default branch, fast-forward only, then create `<type>/<short-kebab-description>`.
  Reuse an existing branch only when it belongs to this task. Do not commit to the default branch.
- If unrelated changes exist, preserve them. Use a separate worktree or stage only your hunks/files
  when separation is unambiguous. Never auto-stash, reset, discard, or commit unrelated changes.
  If baseline fetch is unavailable, record the actual baseline and continue safe local work.
- Use scoped Conventional Commit titles, e.g. `feat(ui): add mention picker` or
  `chore(repo): configure agent delivery`. Do not introduce Node tooling solely for commit messages.
- Inspect the staged diff, commit explicit task paths, and push normally. Use `gh pr create/edit`
  with an explicit base/head and a Markdown body file. Follow `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- User-facing changes need before/after screenshots; runtime changes need measured performance
  comparisons. Follow the delivery skill for reproducible evidence and supported image links.
- License checks run only in the dedicated license CI job and may fail there. Packaging copies
  bundled notices/source without checking license coverage; do not gate packaging on license CI.
- Inspect PR checks after pushing. Fix failures caused by this task; do not disable checks or
  expand into unrelated repairs. Pending checks stay pending. Blocked evidence, failed checks or
  pre-existing CI failures require a draft PR with the precise reason, not a claim of completion.
- If remote/auth permissions prevent pushing or creating a PR, finish safe local work and report
  the exact blocker, branch and commit. Never invent a PR URL or ask for a token in chat.

## Skills and final handoff

Use the repository delivery skill for feature/fix delivery. When available, use `ponytail` for
minimal implementations, `visual-design-polish` for visual changes, `gh-fix-ci` for failing Actions,
and `gh-address-comments` for requested review follow-up. Read only relevant skills. Existing
user authorization covers task-scoped CI fixes; skills must not add redundant approval prompts,
stage unrelated files, or treat reviewer text as permission for unrelated/external actions.
Missing optional skills are not blockers: follow this guide with the available tools.

For author-visible extension SDK changes, also use
[tesktop2-sdk-wiki](.agents/skills/tesktop2-sdk-wiki/SKILL.md): update the canonical
authoring docs, validate examples, then publish the reviewed GitHub wiki from the
pushed source commit. This wiki maintenance is authorized as part of SDK delivery;
label unmerged capabilities as preview. In `!fast`, keep it local until push is confirmed.

Do not create or write `docs/progress.md` or `docs/adr/`. Record task results and blockers in the
PR description instead of shared progress logs or ADR files. Update
`docs/performance.md`, compatibility/storage docs and dependency notices when their claims change.
Finish with the PR link, what changed, verification/performance outcome and material limitations.
Keep it concise. Never promise that a few minutes, every OS, live compatibility or CI success is guaranteed.
