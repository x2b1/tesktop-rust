# User-solved verification

An invite join or a friend request can require a human-completed hCaptcha. Supported
responses keep the existing account connected and open a native **Verification
required** dialog. The invite card offers **Verify** instead of a disabled Join button
and a clipped session error. The dialog shares the application's colors, typography,
focus rules and cancellation controls; the provider widget uses its light or dark
theme.

Choose Verify, complete the provider's check, and Serein submits the resulting
passcode once for the same invite. A new challenge requires another explicit
verification. Cancellation, expiry, logout and replaced requests invalidate the old
response. Gateway membership still determines server access; a CAPTCHA passcode
alone never grants it. Unsupported invite CAPTCHA responses fail that join without
stopping the session. Authentication and account-level challenges retain the existing
stop behavior.

## Friend requests

Sending a friend request (by username or from a profile) or accepting one can return the
same challenge shape. Serein reuses this dialog and scopes the challenge to that single
pending relationship write: the solved passcode is submitted once, on the same request,
through the same `X-Captcha-Key`, `X-Captcha-Rqtoken` and `X-Captcha-Session-Id`
headers. Cancelling or letting the challenge expire releases the pending write so the
user can send it again. A challenge on any other write has no solver wired; that write
fails locally with a bounded reason and the session stays connected.

The sitekey is taken from the service response, never hardcoded. The challenge's
enterprise data, request token and session ID remain bound to that attempt. The
verification view has its own incognito context, an app-local reserved
origin and a random IPC capability. It presents the same user agent as the REST client
that later submits the passcode (`client_core::fingerprint`); on macOS that identity is
Safari, because the widget runs in WebKit and a Chrome-fingerprinted submission of a
WebKit-solved passcode was observed to trigger phone verification on September 13, 2026.
It receives no Discord account token and uses no solver, browser-profile access, origin
spoofing, fingerprint override or backend.
The widget's generated passcode is not saved to SQLite or diagnostics. The browser
engine and hCaptcha necessarily process the user's interaction; this is not a claim
that a third-party widget or OS leaves no traces.

One challenge lives for at most five minutes. Field limits are 128 bytes for the
sitekey, 4 KiB for enterprise data, 2 KiB for the request token, 512 bytes for the
session ID and 8 KiB for the solution. Challenge and solution Debug output is
redacted. The webview closes after its one-slot result is consumed or its scope is
cancelled. Discord can reject a passcode or this embedding environment; errors stay
visible, with no automatic challenge-solving or retry loop.

Implementation evidence checked September 13, 2026:

- [hCaptcha configuration](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/configuration): public sitekey,
  widget themes and completion/error/expiry callbacks.
- [hCaptcha native SDK](https://github.com/hCaptcha/react-native-hcaptcha):
  service-supplied enterprise verification data via `setData`.
- [discord.py-self HTTP implementation](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/http.py)
  and [error parsing](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/master/discord/errors.py):
  challenge fields and `X-Captcha-Key`, `X-Captcha-Rqtoken`,
  `X-Captcha-Session-Id` headers. This is unofficial protocol evidence, not a
  documented Discord third-party client contract.
- [Discord Userdoccers CAPTCHA handling](https://docs.discord.food/topics/captcha-handling),
  checked September 20, 2026: challenge fields, the retry headers above, and friend
  requests listed as a challenged action. Also unofficial evidence.

Windows and macOS embed verification; Linux opens a temporary GTK3/WebKit2GTK 4.1 window. The owner reported a successful
manual live check on September 13, 2026; this is not an agent-observed interoperability
test. macOS/Linux live verification remains unverified. Linux uses an ephemeral network
session and a bounded main-frame query, with no cross-frame passcode IPC. Offline fixtures never
contact hCaptcha or join a server.
