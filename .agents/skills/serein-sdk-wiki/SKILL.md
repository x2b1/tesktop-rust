description: Keep tesktop2's creator wiki synchronized with reviewed extension SDK, capability, ABI, example, theme and authoring-documentation changes. Use during SDK delivery or an explicit wiki refresh.

# Maintain the tesktop2 SDK wiki

The creator wiki is `https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/Serein/wiki`; its separate Git
remote is `https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/Serein.wiki.git`. The authoritative sources
are `examples/extensions/README.md`, `docs/extension-sdk-reference.md`,
`docs/extension-sdk-actions.md`, `docs/extension-sdk-overview.md`,
`docs/extension-sdk-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/extensions.md`, and `docs/theme-api.md`.
Update those alongside the code. Do not maintain a second copy of the API contract.

Apply this skill when changes affect extension manifests, capabilities, action
surfaces, invocation/output fields, limits, lifecycle, SDK helpers, examples or
creator instructions. Internal refactors with no author-visible change need no
wiki publication. This is part of an active delivery session, not a scheduled job.

## Prepare and verify

Read the affected host validation, worker/UI behavior and SDK/example code before
changing claims. Describe capability consent, data scope, resource bounds and
failure behavior. Preserve ABI/source compatibility claims only where checked;
offline fixtures and Wasm checks do not prove live Discord compatibility.

Keep the first-plugin tutorial separate from the field reference. For every new
field, explain its Rust/JSON type, meaning, required grant, when it is absent or
empty, and how to read or return it. Show the full interaction: input, handler,
output, then whether the host applies it immediately or waits for Apply. Use
complete JSON objects and compilable Rust examples; validate them against the
current SDK. Add new fields to the appropriate input, data, output or panel page,
and keep cross-page links and the Home/sidebar navigation working.

Finish canonical docs and source checks, commit and push the task branch using
the ordinary delivery workflow. Fetch `origin` and record the full pushed commit.
The generator reads that commit, never dirty working files. New unreleased behavior
must be labeled `Preview SDK — PR #<number>, not yet released`; use a release label
only when its availability has been verified. The wiki may document a pushed PR
without implying it has merged or shipped.

Clone the wiki into a unique ignored directory under `target/`, or inspect an
existing task-owned clone, its origin and dirty state before reuse. Fetch and
fast-forward the wiki's actual remote default branch. Preserve unrelated pages
and edits; use another clone if necessary.

From the repository root (replace values with the current pushed revision/status):

```powershell
python .agents/skills/tesktop2-sdk-wiki/scripts/sync.py --source-ref <full-pushed-commit> --wiki-dir target/<wiki-clone> --status "Preview SDK — PR #373, not yet released"
python .agents/skills/tesktop2-sdk-wiki/scripts/sync.py --source-ref <full-pushed-commit> --wiki-dir target/<wiki-clone> --status "Preview SDK — PR #373, not yet released" --check
git -C target/<wiki-clone> diff --check
git -C target/<wiki-clone> diff --stat
git -C target/<wiki-clone> diff
```

The helper generates nineteen creator-page files. App data is split into resource pages;
the app-data index preserves earlier section anchors as links. Long references receive
contents derived from their actual headings, excluding fenced examples. Generation
checks internal page names and heading anchors offline. Guide links stay inside the wiki;
source-code links point to the immutable commit. Other wiki files are preserved. `--check`
compares generated output without writing. It never fetches, commits or pushes.
Review the pages as documentation, including navigation, examples, capability
restrictions and preview status; generation alone does not establish accuracy.
After changing the helper, run
`python .agents/skills/tesktop2-sdk-wiki/scripts/test_sync.py`.

## Publish

The owner has authorized maintaining this wiki as part of SDK delivery. When that
authorization applies, publish the reviewed result without another permission
prompt. `!fast` remains local: defer wiki publication until explicit push
confirmation or a separate wiki publication request.

Stage only `Home.md`, `_Sidebar.md`, `Creating-a-Plugin.md`, `Creating-a-Theme.md`,
`API-and-Security-Reference.md`, `Testing-and-Packaging.md`,
`Publishing-to-the-Community-Catalog.md`, `SDK-Inputs-and-Events.md`,
`SDK-App-Data.md`, `SDK-Outputs-and-Actions.md`, `SDK-Panels-and-Storage.md`,
`SDK-Overview.md`, `SDK-Troubleshooting.md`, `SDK-Users-and-Relationships.md`,
`SDK-Channels-and-Guilds.md`, `SDK-Messages.md`, `SDK-Members-and-Roles.md`,
`SDK-Voice-and-Read-State.md`, and `SDK-Settings.md`
in the wiki clone. Inspect the staged diff,
commit with the source revision in the message, and push normally to its existing
origin/default branch. Do not force-push or change repository permissions,
workflows, credentials, or secrets. If a normal push races, fetch and inspect the
upstream changes before reconciling; do not overwrite a conflicting human edit.

Read back the pushed wiki commit and open the affected public pages to verify
navigation, rendered code and source/status links. Record the wiki URL and source
commit in the SDK PR. If access or publication fails, finish the local generated
pages and report the exact blocker; do not claim the wiki was updated.
