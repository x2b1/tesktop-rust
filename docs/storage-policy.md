# Local storage policy and audit

## App extension snapshots and proposals (September 22, 2026)

Independently granted app snapshots contain only already-loaded, accessible data.
The serialized snapshot remains capped at 64 KiB. Directories hold at most 100
channels and 100 joined guilds; the selected channel has at most 32 loaded
recipients. Timeline, members/presence and voice limits remain 50 ordinary loaded
messages, 100 entries each and 64 participant IDs respectively. A simultaneous
`message_details` grant lowers the timeline row limit to 20, retaining its 20-KiB
byte budget and the shared 10-million Wasm fuel limit; valid wire size alone does not
guarantee execution fits the fuel budget. Collector budgets
include item overhead and escaped text: 10 KiB channels, 20 KiB timeline, 6 KiB
each members/presence/channel-detail recipients, and 8 KiB guilds. Names are
sanitized to 128 UTF-8 bytes; timeline rows above 4 KiB of content are omitted.
Message details add up to 20 fresh readable timeline records in an 8-KiB group,
with at most 32 mention IDs, 10 attachment labels and 16 reaction summaries per
record, sharing a 4-KiB nested-record budget. Relationships add up to 100 loaded user/kind records in a 4-KiB group;
separate known flags distinguish unloaded friend/request/restricted lists.
Both groups consume the remaining shared 64-KiB snapshot budget and can truncate
earlier. Message details contain no message text, attachment URLs/bytes or deleted/
ephemeral records; relationships contain no notes, nicknames or status payloads.
Channel metadata and member details each add a 6-KiB group within the same
64-KiB snapshot ceiling. A settings topic is capped at 2,048 UTF-8 bytes and
appears only from already-loaded channel settings with current access. Parent/
category traversal follows at most two visible same-guild links; thread flags
use the already-loaded post. Permission values remain optional decisions.
Member details require a matching fresh guild member pane, cap at 20 members,
32 role IDs each and 32 loaded catalog roles (2-KiB catalog sub-budget), and
include only a matching already-loaded successful server profile. Server bio,
pronouns and join-time text cap at 1,024/256/64 UTF-8 bytes. No member lookup,
profile load or settings fetch occurs. Combined snapshot pressure trims member
rows first and may omit either group; no cache or queue ceiling is enlarged.
Rich message content adds at most 10 loaded nondeleted/nonephemeral summaries /
8 KiB. Each has at most three embed summaries, four fields per embed and three
sticker labels; nested message rows share 2 KiB and each embed's fields share
768 bytes. Only bounded embed text, labels, media-presence booleans and reference
markers are copied, never media URL fields/bytes or referenced text. A poll is
only an absent/unsupported marker; questions, options and results are not retained.
Forum data adds ten resident readable child threads / 6 KiB, with optional loaded
post flags and no tags or archive discovery. Conversation activity adds up to
eight current typing IDs and twenty IDs from a loaded successful pin page / 2 KiB.
Unknown pins stay absent. These groups share the unchanged 64-KiB snapshot cap;
rows may be trimmed or entire groups omitted. No fetching or persistence is added.

Public host discovery adds only fixed API/SDK revision and supported capability/
event names on every invocation, without a grant or account information. It counts
toward the unchanged 256-KiB invocation limit. Runtime failure classification uses
fixed messages for fuel, allocation, stack, traps and invalid/oversized inputs or
responses. Raw interpreter errors and private payloads are never retained in
these messages; no new diagnostic cache, log, telemetry or lifecycle worker exists.
Partial lists declare truncation; none is a history export.

The account-profile grant supplies only the current account label/avatar hash
and an optional matching, already-loaded own profile. Loading, limited, stale or
failed profile data is omitted. Bio/pronouns are capped at 2,048/256 UTF-8 bytes;
asset hashes at 128 bytes. Channel details omit hidden parent IDs and withhold
last-message IDs/counts without history permission. Disconnect or unavailable
selected-channel data removes the corresponding groups. No snapshot exposes
email, credentials, account connections, deleted/ephemeral bodies, raw media,
device paths or unrelated profiles. Member server-profile data stays in the
matching selected-guild scope. An active accessible DM/private channel can
supply ordinary text and loaded recipients with the corresponding grants.

App events share the unchanged 32-item / 64-KiB reactive queue and ten-starts-per-
second limit. Fixed dirty flags classify current-session account/channel/member/presence/
read-state invalidation hints without retaining raw event payloads; local profile,
directory and read changes use bounded scalar observation. Hints can describe
no-op or rejected updates and are not an audit stream. Detailed events require `data_events`, `app_events`
and their corresponding read grant. Recovery/resynchronization hints use these
same bounds and do not replay missed events. Pending detailed descriptors coalesce by
kind per plugin; legacy lifecycle observation retains its existing coalescing.
Descriptors hold no snapshot: current granted data is collected only at dispatch.
Invocation and pending-result copies each have the 64-KiB snapshot bound. The UI
discards copied input snapshots when presenting a result. Permission changes,
disconnect, account changes and disabling retire affected proposals/queued work.
There is no event journal, timer worker, schema migration or new cache. Snapshot
construction performs no network or disk IO; no new private data is persisted.

A result can propose one bounded host action (at most 8 KiB of serialized effects).
Navigation, clipboard, local notices, reading-setting patches and existing-call
mute/deafen/leave require a visible user confirmation. Voice confirmation binds the
original call request; stale requests cannot affect a replacement call. Background
events cannot produce these actions. Reading patches use existing preference
validation/persistence; plugin data still requires the separate `storage` grant.

## Navigation and process-scan allocation reductions (September 22, 2026)

Navigation UI caches filter frequent unrelated message, reaction and member events
from their revision keys. Four fixed counters plus one explicit invalidation counter
add 40 bytes per account state; unknown event kinds and local revision changes still
invalidate conservatively. Cache item/byte ceilings and account isolation are unchanged.
The channel sidebar reuses the core channel index instead of allocating another
full-account tree on each rebuild, and grows temporary row buffers with the displayed
scope instead of reserving space for every account channel. READY reconciliation uses a sorted vector of
channel references, at most 1 MiB of element storage at 131,072 entries on 64-bit,
and releases it before removing old channels. Old and replacement account snapshots
still overlap during validation; this is not a whole-process memory bound.

Linux game detection reads at most 513 bytes per command-line file to validate the
existing 512-byte executable-path limit. Matching keeps at most eight path-component
references on the stack and shares one normalized suffix allocation across lookups.
The opt-in behavior, ten-second scan interval, process count and catalog limits are
unchanged; no new worker, dependency, persistence or network request is introduced.

## Remote video lifetime cleanup (September 21, 2026)

A completed camera/stream announcement cancels a decoder only after its user's
final announced video source disappears. Queued frames carry a small cancellable
lifetime token, so camera-off and rapid off/on cannot recreate a stopped decoder
from old queued frames. Cancellation survives a full queue; unchanged announcements
do not wake the decoder. Hardware callbacks also check their original lifetime.

The active-token table is capped at the existing 16 source users. Old fixed-size
tokens can survive only in the 16-item / 16-MiB frame queue, the worker's current
frame, and the existing at-most-eight decoders; they contain no media or account
strings. The 1080p picture limit remains unchanged. Stopping the final video
lifetime also frees the shared RGBA scratch allocation (up to 8,294,400 initialized
bytes); codec/driver resources are released by dropping their decoders. Allocator
and driver retention mean this is not an equivalent process-RSS guarantee.

## Startup and Gateway allocation reuse (September 21, 2026)

Startup builds the bundled base font set without inflating the 16,467,736-byte
CJK face. Its existing on-demand worker adds that face only after CJK text is
encountered. The Twemoji PNG decodes into one 16,515,072-byte egui pixel buffer
and premultiplies alpha in place, removing the separate full-size RGBA conversion
buffer. Decoder and GPU staging allocations remain additional; these are not
whole-process RSS guarantees. No assets, image quality or cache limits change.

The CJK detector remembers at most 512 immutable layout-job identities through weak
references, within a 128 KiB fixed-allocation budget. It never retains text, style
sections, glyph meshes or a strong job reference. Reused jobs skip Unicode scanning;
new/edited jobs are checked, capacity rollover clears the cache, and the first CJK
match releases it. Render shapes still need traversal until that first match.

The streaming Gateway decoder releases compressed-input allocations larger than
128 KiB after completing a payload. Smaller buffers remain reusable; incomplete
payloads and the zlib dictionary stay intact. The existing 64 MiB input/output
limits are unchanged. Repeated large packets trade fresh allocations for lower
retention between packets; no timer or additional worker is introduced.

## Leading text-row measurements (September 19, 2026)

The timeline tracks which cached heights were measured for the current state and
dimensions. This set contains only IDs from the bounded active timeline: at most
500 fixed-size IDs (4,000 bytes of ID payload, plus bounded B-tree allocation).
State/dimension changes clear it, and channel/session changes reset the view.
Existing heights remain available as resize estimates. No message payloads, disk
records or additional history windows are retained.

## Query and decoder reuse (September 19, 2026)

The message cache creates an additive index on account, channel, decimal ID length
and ID. This avoids sorting channel reads while preserving unsigned 64-bit IDs as
text. Existing schema-20 caches gain the index on open; stored payloads and schema
compatibility are unchanged. Index pages count toward the existing 64 MiB database
ceiling. Channel loads reuse the connection's bounded prepared-statement cache.
Full message comparisons and secure deletion remain enabled.

Software video decoders share one initialized RGBA scratch buffer, growing only
to the largest accepted picture in that worker (at most 8,294,400 bytes of requested
capacity). Smaller pictures borrow only their exact-size prefix. The high-water
buffer remains until the worker exits, trading retention after a resolution decrease
for avoiding repeated allocations between differently sized streams. No extra
per-participant buffer or uninitialized memory is introduced.
## Profile server identity tags (September 19, 2026)

An ordinary in-memory user may retain one server identity: one guild ID, a tag of at
most four Unicode scalars / 16 UTF-8 bytes and one validated badge hash. It shares the
existing byte-bounded user, message and session caches and is released with those
records. The field is omitted from SQLite serialization, so this change adds no stored
profile metadata, schema migration, queue, network request or background work.

## Server-wide member lookup (September 17, 2026)

Mention autocomplete retains at most one query of 64 Unicode scalars / 256 UTF-8
bytes and 100 member results / 128 KiB. The query and results are session-only;
navigation, disconnect and logout retire them. The Gateway watch channel retains
two replaceable queries: one composer query and one visible-author lookup. Queued
and active requests have the same fixed two-slot bound. Matching chunk bodies are
capped at 512 KiB, then validated before entering the existing byte-budgeted event queue.
Unrelated chunks are ignored; no guild directory cache or persistence is added.

## Forum post context menu (September 15, 2026)

Post actions share the existing single pending channel-operation slot and retain
one fixed-size post-details snapshot. REST responses are capped at 64 KiB; the
title draft is bounded to 100 characters / 400 UTF-8 bytes. Favorites reuse the
existing account-isolated preference storage. Post metadata and editor drafts
remain session-only, with no new database table, queue or background polling.

## Theme maker and embedded backgrounds (September 15, 2026)

Editor saves reuse the device-wide themes directory and active selection record;
no SQLite schema change is needed. Stored records add a default-false `local_theme`
marker so a save can replace an editor-created theme without overwriting an imported
or reviewed package. The eight-installed-theme and 16 MiB package limits remain.
Each theme embeds at most one 2 MiB background PNG/JPEG and one separate 2 MiB
card cover PNG/JPEG; no source image path is persisted.
Removing a theme deletes only Serein's copy, preserving originals and exports.
Exports use a unique temporary sibling and replace the selected destination only
after a complete write. Failed saves/exports leave the editor draft available.

The worker decodes the selected theme background, an explicit editor draft, and
installed card covers, bounded to 4,096 pixels per edge, 4,000,000 pixels and
32 MiB decoder allocation per source. Covers shrink to at most 640 x 360 before
entering UI state. Installed metadata and catalog cards contain no compressed
image copies. The active background and one draft background can each retain
16,000,000 RGBA bytes; at most eight cover thumbnails and eight visible-card
textures can each retain 7,372,800 RGBA bytes before GPU allocations. Image
resources are released when replaced, removed or reset.
The existing four-job extension queue bounds pending editor packages to at most
16 MiB of image bytes in addition to their bounded metadata; one worker and one
result slot remain. These are allocation ceilings, not measured process RSS.
Local image picking and export are explicit host actions; plugins gain no file or
network access. There is no image cache directory, telemetry, or automatic upload.

## Last-viewed server channels (September 14, 2026)

Server navigation remembers at most 1,024 guild/channel ID pairs in session RAM
(16 KiB vector payload, plus its fixed header). Updating a visit replaces that
server's entry; the oldest visit is evicted at capacity. There are no names,
message contents, timers, disk writes, or schema changes. Logout releases the
list; it is not restored across application restarts. Reopening a server checks
current channel membership, supported kind, and view permission before selecting
its remembered channel, otherwise preferring an accessible ordinary text/forum
channel. Voice selection only opens its existing preview, never joins a call.
With no accessible channel, the existing conversation remains intact.

Opened threads keep a separate session-only list of at most 1,024 IDs (8 KiB
vector payload). The channel sidebar shows the four most recently opened threads
under each parent, newest first; loading a thread does not count as opening it.
Removal and logout clear the corresponding entries. Nothing is written to disk.

## Friends-home derived UI caches (September 14, 2026)

Friends Online/All retain one filtered, sorted boxed ID list: at most 4,000 IDs
(32,000 bytes), plus one search string of at most 128 Unicode scalars (512 UTF-8
bytes). Relationship and presence-membership revisions invalidate derived rows;
Online also keys connection state. Visible rows resolve current profiles and
presence on each paint. No copied friend profiles or additional presence index
are retained.

The server rail retains at most 15 DM IDs (120 bytes) and one sorted boxed badge
record per guild represented in validated navigation: at most 131,072 records,
16 bytes each on the supported 64-bit targets (2 MiB). Folder rows retain at most
131,072 guild rows plus 200 folder headers, each 40 bytes on 64-bit targets
(5,250,880 bytes). Rebuilds use temporary bounded vectors/maps in addition to the
previous cache; these ceilings are not measured process RSS. Session generation,
state revision and local expansion/call changes retire stale derived views.
UI session reset releases the caches. No disk records or schema migration change.

## Large account startup (September 14, 2026)

Account navigation supports 131,072 guild/channel entries within 128 MiB of estimated
navigation and permission storage. The permission mirror has a 64 MiB sub-budget,
131,072 aggregate roles and 1,048,576 aggregate overwrites; per-object role/overwrite
validation remains unchanged. Admission reserves room for 4,000 cached permission decisions
(128 estimated bytes each). The cache may grow to 32,768 entries, but only within the
sub-budget the admitted metadata leaves free, so a full sidebar badge scan of a large
account does not evict its own decisions.
Incoming read-state snapshot vectors use at most 131,072 entries / 16 MiB; retained
read maps are bounded by account channels, with the existing separate activity/alert budgets.
Notification preferences
use bounded account collections / 32 MiB. These are on-demand ceilings, not reservations
or an RSS guarantee. This section supersedes the older account snapshot limits below.

The reliable FIFO retains its 4,008-item capacity; ordinary events share a 32 MiB budget
and a 4 MiB per-event limit. One startup snapshot may use a separate memory reservation,
capped at 128 MiB including its metadata, within that same FIFO; consuming or dropping
it releases the reservation. Concurrent startup snapshots are rejected. Startup buffers,
the prior account state during replacement, decoding, maps and runtime/allocator overhead
can add to peak memory. Gateway compression still caps input and output at 64 MiB each.

Rejected optional READY metadata is discarded by section. Only fixed feature-warning flags
remain; invalid read state stays unknown, and missing settings or DND suppress alerts.
Fresh READY/logout release stale optional state. Valid authoritative updates can restore
features. No payload logs, account database changes, background directory fetching, or
new persistent caches are added.

Cross-server emoji (September 14): browsing and provenance reuse the existing bounded joined
guild catalogs and avatar cache. Picker search retains at most 1,000 borrowed catalog pairs;
autocomplete retains at most 256 ranked suggestions, with custom names capped at 32 ASCII bytes
and source labels at 120 Unicode scalars. Only visible cells request artwork. No new catalog,
network endpoint, persistent metadata, background job, or storage migration is introduced.
Emoji information cards resolve names and source servers on demand from the loaded catalogs;
unknown/deleted source metadata remains explicitly unknown.

Notification sounds (September 21): the Discord sound pack is embedded, with no
runtime files or downloads. The files total 583,331 bytes on disk;
source attribution and redistribution limitations are in `assets/sounds/README.md`.
The existing single lazy worker and one-slot fixed-size request queue decode one
track at a time outside rendering/audio callbacks. Each asset is capped at
128 KiB encoded, 44.1 or 48 kHz stereo and six seconds decoded (at most 576,000
source samples / 2,304,000 bytes, excluding vector capacity). Conversion retains
at most six seconds of stereo f32 at the output
device rate, capped at 192 kHz / 9,216,000 bytes, alongside source PCM during
conversion. Decoder/device allocations are separate. Playback buffers are
released after each cue; cancellation silences the callback and is checked by
the worker every 20 ms. No notification-audio cache or storage migration is added.
Outgoing ringback retains one fixed-size channel/request/confirmation slot for
the active explicit call only. Ringing metadata and the repeat timer remain
session-only and are cleared when the attempt ends; no call history is saved.
Join/leave feedback retains at most 64 remote user IDs (512 bytes plus fixed flags)
for the one live call, with no allocation or persisted membership history.

Explicit media clipboard copies (September 13) reuse the bounded attachment
download worker. One original video, at most 100 MiB, remains in a randomized
`serein-clipboard-*` OS temporary directory while its file clipboard entry is
usable. The next media copy, logout, or normal exit releases it; pasting requires
the app to remain open. Image staging files are removed after decoding. All file
work and cleanup run outside rendering. Forced termination or filesystem failures
can leave a temporary file; cleanup errors are visible. Clipboard contents belong
to the OS and may also be retained by clipboard managers. No cache schema changes.

Chat author membership (schema 18): `author_roles` JSON (at most 512 IDs, 16 KiB)
and optional `author_nick` (512 UTF-8 bytes / 128 characters) travel with each
cached message row. Schema-17 and older binaries cannot reopen this upgraded cache.

Reaction pills (schema 23): nullable `reactions` JSON, at most 16 KiB, stores the last
known emoji set and counts so a reopened channel can place the strip before history
returns. NULL means unknown and paints no strip. History replaces the row. Schema-22
and older binaries cannot reopen this upgraded cache.

Reading motion (schema 19): one checked application-wide boolean stores whether wheel,
message-target and jump-to-present scrolling animate. Existing databases migrate to enabled;
disabling changes only local rendering and adds no account data or timeline storage.
Schema-18 and older binaries cannot reopen this upgraded cache.

Forwarded messages (schema 16): one checked, default-false `forwarded` column marks
the immutable snapshot body. Text, embeds and attachments reuse existing bounded
message storage; source channels/messages are never fetched. Existing rows retain
their content and default to ordinary messages until refreshed. Schema-15 binaries
cannot reopen this upgraded cache.

Channel preferences (September 21, schema 15): favorites, pins and collapsed categories are
device-local, account-isolated SQLite preferences. Pins cover home DMs. Favorites cover guild
channels. All three lists together contain at most 256 IDs,
with at most 6 KiB retained vector storage and an 8 KiB serialized record. Loading
and saving run on the existing bounded cache worker; corrupt/oversized records and
save failures are shown. Shortcuts survive restart and are removed on account
logout. They do not sync to Discord. Channel edit drafts, authoritative settings,
pending actions and locally observed mute expiry times remain bounded session RAM.
Each category/channel settings snapshot retains at most 1000 overwrites (48 KiB),
a 400-byte name and a 16 KiB topic, under 64 KiB total heap allocation. The UI holds
one before/after pair; core holds one loaded snapshot and one pending edit, with
one additional before/after pair in the existing command lane. Settings are read
and written on demand and never persisted locally. Picker suggestions reuse the
loaded member window and role mirror; searches are capped at 64 characters and
explicit member IDs at 20 characters.
Shortcut restore retains one request when the storage queue is full, then admits it
when worker completions free space. Only one load can be in flight; account/session
reset clears its flags. Actual storage failures stop automatic retries and retain
the explicit Retry shortcuts action. Queue pressure alone no longer reports a
failed restore. Queue, payload and database bounds are unchanged.

Community extensions (September 12): packages and grants are stored under the
application data directory's `extensions` subtree. Plugin data/grants are
account-isolated; declarative themes are device preferences. Up to eight installed
themes remain available in Colour preset; switching only changes the bounded
64-byte active theme identifier and retains the packages. Installation,
validation, invocation storage and removal run on a bounded background worker.
Disabling removes Serein's package and extension data, and failed cleanup is
reported and retried. Logout removes the account's plugin data. Imported
original files and source repositories are never deleted. No credentials belong
in plugin storage; it is not encrypted. Only bounded metadata may remain after
successful disable. Shop descriptions and optional preview URLs/hashes belong to
bounded catalog metadata (1 MiB / 256 entries). The validated, shared plugin/theme
catalog is atomically saved to `extensions/catalog.json` within that same byte/item
budget. A failed fetch/validation preserves the last valid catalog; malformed or
oversized disk caches are ignored while installed themes still load. Opening
Themes or Extensions refreshes metadata only, never installed packages or local edits.
Visible cards may fetch a PNG/JPEG
preview using credential-free validated public HTTPS; bytes are hash/size checked,
limited to 256 KiB compressed, decoded off-thread within 4,194,304 source pixels,
and reduced to at most 640 x 360. Eight UI thumbnails cost at most 7,372,800 RGBA
bytes plus GPU/framework overhead. Images stay in memory only; no preview disk
cache or periodic background polling is added. Existing single-worker/four-job bounds and
session cancellation apply. See `extensions.md` for the creator and permission model.

The optional `message_events` grant delivers accepted live events from the active,
accessible conversation. It excludes history replay, search, cached pages and
ephemeral interaction replies. Text snapshots are limited to 16 KiB per event;
delete events contain IDs only. A transient queue holds at most 32 deliveries /
64 KiB of owned event data and metadata, shared across plugins. One event runs
at a time on the existing worker, at most ten starts per second; its invocation
and pending-result copy are each bounded by the event limit. Excess events are
dropped with a status notice. Navigation, lost access, disconnect, session changes
and disable retire queued events and cancel in-flight work. There is no event
journal or retry. Plugins may persist data only with the separate bounded
`storage` grant; the counter example stores numeric totals without message text
or identifiers.

Schema 13 adds a constrained webhook boolean to cached message authors. It comes
from the service message webhook_id and follows the existing bounded author data
through message, reply, and profile views. Legacy rows default to unknown (false)
until refreshed; no name, bot flag, or profile error is used to infer a webhook.
The migration preserves existing messages, settings, and drafts.

Group conversation actions (September 11): names and icon hashes are session
navigation metadata, with icon capacity included in channel/event byte counts.
The editor retains one name (100 characters), one bounded PNG data URI, and one
256x256 RGBA preview. A single native picker/worker admits a regular file up to
8 MiB, decodes outside rendering with 4096x4096 and 64 MiB decoder limits, then
center-crops and downsizes to at most 256 pixels. Encoded PNG is capped at
256 KiB (data URI at 349,550 bytes). Selecting a file never uploads it; Save
queues one bounded group write. Pending core state and completion events do not
retain the image payload. Closing the editor releases its draft/preview; stale
picker results are discarded by session, channel and editor revision.
Source paths and chosen image bytes are not persisted or logged. Confirmed CDN
icons use the existing bounded avatar cache; no new database or cache schema is
introduced. Confirmed leave invalidates cached channel history through the
existing access-removal path and keeps the user's text draft.

User context actions (September 11): close-DM, block and notification-mute preferences are
written directly to Discord through the existing authenticated transport, never a new local
settings file. Relationship state keeps at most 4000 fixed ID/bool entries with a 128 KiB
estimated allocation ceiling; only one fixed-size action may be pending. DM mute state reuses
the existing bounded notification overrides. Logout clears both with other account RAM state.
Closing a DM preserves its local draft. Accepted navigation removal uses the existing account
history invalidation path, which can clear other cached history but preserves drafts. The
standalone offline fixture changes synthetic RAM only and issues no service or storage writes.

Current reply metadata schema is 10. It adds one constrained reply_deleted boolean to each
bounded message row; legacy rows default to unknown (false). Only an explicit service-null
reference on a valid same-channel reply/context-menu message establishes deletion. Nested
referenced bodies are discarded. The migration retains schema-9 message kinds/content markers,
reading preferences and drafts in the existing transaction. Saved/loaded markers require a
positive earlier target and message kind 19 or 23; malformed cache markers are rejected.
Accepted deletion effects use the existing cache epoch and deletion queue, so pre-deletion
loads/saves cannot restore the body. Queue saturation falls back to existing history clearing,
preserving drafts. Older binaries limited to schema 9 cannot reopen the upgraded cache.

The September 10 PR integration uses schema 9 to combine system-message `message_kind`,
unsupported-content `extra_content` and the reading/layout singleton. Both independent
schema-7 layouts and schema 8 are migrated by detecting the actual message columns. Existing
rows, drafts and settings are retained; older binaries with a lower schema ceiling cannot
reopen the upgraded cache. No unpublished reply-navigation metadata is included.

Reading/layout settings use one application-wide SQLite singleton: integer display
scale 80..150 percent, sidebar width 190..360 logical points, wide-layout People visibility,
GIF animation, media-link hiding, external-link confirmation and smooth scrolling, plus
scrolling speed (25–300 percent, default 100). Schema 24 adds the checked speed column
transactionally; existing settings keep their prior speed.
Missing row means 100 percent / 236 points with People, media-link hiding, link confirmation and
smooth scrolling enabled while GIF animation is disabled. Reset removes just this override in an
atomic statement; neither theme nor account drafts/history are reset. Logout retains these
non-account settings. Startup reads them on the existing worker; delayed results never override
an explicit user choice. No account identifiers or message content enter this record.

Interactive changes coalesce for 300 ms into at most one queued write and one fixed-size latest
value. A full or failed worker reports an unsaved change without an automatic retry loop;
Retry saving is deliberate. Closing with pending/failed writes prompts before discarding.
In-app preview edits are not saved; a write already requested outside preview still completes.
The standalone --demo does not start the SQLite worker. Narrow People overlays and outer window geometry remain session-local.
Notification opt-in, hidden-channel visibility, primary RGB color, audio devices (up to 1,024 bytes each),
input profile/custom processing, push-to-talk and gain are saved in the device-wide `app_preferences`
SQLite singleton (16 KiB maximum), using the existing background worker. These survive
restart/logout; demo controls never read or write them. Save failures remain visible.
The optional voice profile preserves older records: an absent profile migrates the legacy
suppression boolean to Custom with RNNoise/Off, AEC on, and no AGC/sensitivity gate.
The selected profile and retained Custom settings are saved together; suppression strength
is bounded to 0–3 and sensitivity to −80..=0 dBFS or disabled. Active processing settings
replace one fixed-size watch snapshot. Existing eight-frame PCM queue limits are unchanged;
processing has no downloaded model, recording, or persistent audio data.

Recently visited conversations now keep at most two dormant RAM timelines in the current
account session, moved rather than cloned. Only readable Fresh ordinary text windows are parked;
search-target ranges and transient archived threads are excluded. Promotion rechecks identity
and read permission, shows a Loading preview, and always requests a fresh recent service page.
This is a preview cache, not saved historical scroll position. It avoids a SQLite read on a hit.
Unknown/deleted-only row handling retains the same guards as the active window.

Active plus dormant timelines share 1,475 rows and 16 MiB minus 66 KiB of estimated allocations,
reserving 25 rows and 258 KiB for the single search/pins page and query/view metadata. Estimation
includes retained payloads, pending patches, mutation/deletion sets, container storage and a
B-tree slack allowance; it is not an allocator or RSS measurement. Each individual timeline keeps
its existing 500-row / 4 MiB payload limit. Oldest whole dormant windows are evicted when needed,
without touching drafts or pending sends. Incoming mutations evict the affected dormant channel;
permission/identity changes prune it, and session replacement/resync/logout removes all dormant
history. Clear cached history removes dormant RAM and disk history while preserving the active
displayed conversation. No new disk data, database schema, worker or service request is added.

Loaded messages deleted by the service leave only their ID as a session-local reading row.
Author, body, attachment and embed metadata are dropped from the timeline and its formatted /
revealed-content views. An untouched open editor closes; text the user modified remains an
unsent edit with Copy/Cancel and no Save. Old editor undo snapshots are cleared immediately,
including when the user is viewing a different channel. Unknown deletion IDs never create visible rows.
Live and deleted rows share the 500-row / 4 MiB estimated storage ceiling; deletion guards
retain the existing 1,024-ID bound. Placeholders are not written to SQLite.

Gateway deletion removes matching account/channel/message rows in a bounded SQLite transaction,
including inactive and loading conversations. Cache history operations carry a session epoch;
deletion invalidates older queued snapshots and returned pages. If deletion cannot be queued,
history reuse pauses until account-scoped cleanup finishes. Cleanup retains at most 16 pending
account IDs in addition to the existing 16-command / 16-result worker queues, preserving drafts
and unrelated accounts. Storage failure or cleanup-scope overflow disables history caching for
the rest of the session and reports that content may remain on disk. This cannot guarantee
removal after filesystem failure or forced termination; no forensic-erasure claim is made.
No schema change or persistent deletion journal is introduced.

Schema 7 adds one integer extra_content column (0..31) for presence of polls, sticker_items,
legacy stickers, component arrays and the Components V2 flag. RAM uses five booleans; partial
updates preserve each source independently. Poll answers and sticker data are not retained. Schema 20 additionally retains
typed component trees, application IDs and original message flags, within the existing history budgets. Existing cached rows default to no known markers until normal
service revalidation because older builds discarded that metadata. Account isolation, existing
database/cache limits and logout deletion remain unchanged; unsupported content is not rendered
or executed from SQLite. Invalid stored marker bits reject the cached page.

Microphone gain and speaker volume are saved bounded integer percentages (0..=200),
initially 100. System mixer settings are unchanged. Two callback atomics hold active levels;
no audio is retained. Preview levels remain session-only.

Loaded thread navigation shares the 4,000-entry account navigation and 4 MiB normalized navigation budgets. Incoming thread syncs additionally cap combined parent/thread entries at 4,000 and normalized snapshot metadata at 2 MiB; wire JSON remains capped at 4 MiB. Removed-member arrays are capped at 4,000 and are discarded after checking the owner. Navigation/member lists are session-only; selected thread messages/drafts reuse existing account history/draft storage. Actual accepted thread removals enqueue the existing account-wide history clear, preserving drafts; ignored, empty-scope and rename-only events do not clear disk history. This coarse invalidation trades refetch cost for simpler deletion, without new tables or workers.

The owner explicitly withdrew the no-storage policy on 2026-09-09. Local files, SQLite, saved drafts, settings and caches are permitted. The implementation persists **history with embeds, attachments and mentioned users; avatar/server-icon/banner/preview images; drafts; appearance; reading/layout preferences; and the login token**. Outer window geometry remains session-local.

| Data | Location / bound | Removal |
|---|---|---|
| Discord token | OS credential store, service `cz.viceverse.serein`, account `discord-session` for the session restored on launch and `discord-session.<account id>` for each remembered account; at most 2048 bytes each. A per-account entry is written once, when the roster records none, and rewritten only for a token the owner just supplied: on macOS every access to an existing entry is governed by that item's keychain ACL | Explicit logout / Forget saved login removes both entries for that account; forgetting or pruning a saved account removes its per-account entry; invalid-token expiry also requests deletion |
| Remembered accounts (switcher) | `accounts` table in `client.sqlite3`: at most 8 rows of account ID, username, display name (64 bytes each), avatar hash, last-use timestamp and a flag recording whether the credential store holds that account's entry; no token | Logging out of, or forgetting, that account; the least recently used row is pruned past 8, taking its token and cached data with it |
| History and drafts | `dirs::data_local_dir()/serein/client.sqlite3` | Clear cached history also clears service images and keeps drafts; logout clears the authenticated account’s history and drafts |
| Messages | 500 per window, at most 20 stored channel windows globally, 48 MiB estimated text/metadata; SQLite main database capped at 64 MiB | Oldest touched channel evicted transactionally |
| Avatar, server-icon, profile-banner and message-preview PNGs | Account subdirectory beneath `dirs::data_local_dir()/serein/avatars`; 1 GiB / 4096 files per account, 90 days since last use, at most 2 MiB per preview (512 KiB for icons/avatars) | Clear cache or account logout; versioned avatar/icon/banner keys and hashed media-source keys separate changed images |
| Selected profile metadata | One session-memory record, at most 64 KiB; profile response body at most 256 KiB | Closing/changing the profile, session reset or logout; no SQLite profile table |
| Explicit attachment downloads | User-selected destination, 1 byte through 100 MiB per original file; one active dialog/transfer; randomized sibling partial while writing | Cancel/error removes the partial when possible; completed downloads remain user-owned outside cache cleanup |
| Selected upload source | Up to ten session-only paths (4096 encoded bytes each), filenames (256 UTF-8 bytes each) and size/modified metadata; 500,000,000 bytes total, read in 64 KiB chunks | Removal, send completion/failure, cancellation or session teardown; sources are never copied to recovery/cache files or deleted |
| Drafts | 64 globally, at most 2 MiB content; each draft at most 8192 UTF-8 bytes | Clear draft, confirmed send, or account logout |
| Bundled TestCord plugin settings | `tesktop-plugins.json` beside `client.sqlite3` under `dirs::data_local_dir()/tesktop2`: at most 256 compiled-in plugins, 48 keys and 16 KiB per plugin, 256 KiB per file; enable flags and settings only, never message bodies. The MessageLogger record is session memory only: 2000 entries, 4 MiB, bodies capped at 2000 characters, and a 256 KiB clipboard export |
| Appearance | One application-wide SQLite row: Light or Dark; absent means System | Select System to remove the override; retained across account logout |
| Reading/layout | One application-wide SQLite row with eight bounded scalar fields | Reset reading and layout removes only this override; retained across account logout |
| Theme preset | One application-wide SQLite row (`theme_variant`, ≤32-byte key such as `onyx`); absent means Default | Select Default to remove it; unknown keys are ignored; retained across account logout |
| SQLite working files | DELETE journal mode, in-memory temporary tables, 2 MiB page cache; transaction journal may temporarily add disk usage | SQLite transaction completion; normal SQLite crash recovery |
| Voice credentials, DAVE identities/keys and PCM/Opus audio | Session memory only; one call, bounded media queues; no recording or audio cache | Hangup, failure, logout and application teardown; no forensic-erasure claim |
| Audio devices, input profile/custom processing, push-to-talk and gain | Device-wide `app_preferences` SQLite singleton, bounded to 16 KiB; device names ≤1,024 bytes each | Retained across restart/logout; demo changes remain in memory |
| Authentication page | Wry incognito on Windows/macOS; ephemeral WebKit2GTK 4.1 context on Linux, destroyed on token handoff/cancel/timeout | Platform engine teardown; OS artifacts not promised erased |

Typical database directories: macOS `~/Library/Application Support/serein`, Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%/serein`, Linux `$XDG_DATA_HOME/serein` or `~/.local/share/serein`. The Unix directory is private (0700). Database contents are **not encrypted by Serein**. OS token protection does not encrypt history, backups or drafts.

The app writes no background log, analytics, crash upload, saved password, MFA ticket, or plaintext credential file. A separate credential-free CDN downloader loads visible avatars, server icons, profile banners and validated service-proxied message images. Build outputs, this documentation, synthetic test databases and package files are development artifacts.

SQLite work is serialized on a worker. Normal startup opens the database to load appearance and reading/layout preferences before authentication; `--demo` does not open the database, credential store or network. Schema version 8 adds the bounded reading/layout singleton while preserving author metadata, embeds/suppression, attachments, mentioned users and unsupported-content presence bits; older history and drafts remain readable. Embed and attachment JSON are each capped at 256 KiB per message; mentioned users are capped at 100 entries and 128 KiB JSON. All three contribute to eviction accounting. Signed original/preview URLs and mention names/avatar hashes may be retained in unencrypted cached message metadata. Draft save status is visible; a full queue or disk failure is reported and must not be described as saved. An interrupted send may leave a saved draft for content Discord already accepted: recovered text never automatically sends. Normal close waits for queued store work if necessary; logout orders one transactional account deletion after earlier writes. Deletion is not a forensic erasure guarantee.

Saved recovery text prefers the current nonempty draft, otherwise the most recent unresolved send in that channel. Only a matching own-author/channel/nonce confirmation updates this recovery record. This is one recovery draft per channel, not a durable multi-message outbox; additional unresolved sends remain in RAM and the close prompt warns before discarding them. Incoming hidden-channel events do not rewrite the active cache; accepted active-view changes are coalesced into at most one snapshot per event-drain pass.

Source checks verify disabled eframe persistence, disabled REST cookies, one renderer, and an ephemeral webview request. egui-wgpu 0.36.2 creates its render pipeline with `cache: None`. Avatar decoding and disk I/O run on a dedicated worker; egui receives bounded decoded results. These are chosen implementation settings, **not a renewed no-storage requirement**.

Offline SQLite tests exercise real temporary-file reopen, schema upgrade, appearance reset, read-only failure, draft capacity rollback, account isolation, 20-channel eviction and atomic logout rollback/deletion. They remove their synthetic test files. OS credential-store and webview write tracing remain unverified. Windows WebView2 may create user-data/runtime artifacts even for InPrivate mode; this must be measured, and old WebView2 runtimes that ignore incognito must not be claimed ephemeral. No zero-byte storage claim is made.

A process-write trace was attempted with `sudo -n fs_usage -w -f filesys -t 3 <synthetic-app-pid>`; the OS returned “a password is required.” No trace was obtained. The account/cache code and synthetic SQLite files were tested, but actual process-write behavior is not certified.

Avatar request tracking retains at most 2,048 keys of at most 2,054 bytes each
(4,206,592 key bytes, plus bounded map metadata). Pending entries remain tracked
until completion; capacity defers new requests rather than evicting pending work.
Failed entries expire five seconds after failure, permitting an on-demand retry.

Current image limits include the GIF and larger-viewer features added after September 10.
One worker decodes serially while up to eight credential-free downloads overlap.
The UI tracks 128 requests. The worker holds at most 1,024 keys, and viewer keys run before inline keys.
Ordinary encoded bodies are capped at 2 MiB. Animation bodies are capped at 16 MiB.
A still message picture accepts at most 32 MiB encoded.
Eight overlapping downloads can hold one body each, separately from decoder memory.
The completed encoded source is released before waiting to deliver its decoded result.
Avatar/icon decoding accepts at most 512 KiB encoded, 256×256 source, 1 MiB decoder
allocations and 128×128 output. Previews/banners use 1024×1024 source, 8 MiB decoder
allocations and a 512-pixel output edge. A still message picture allows an 8192 canvas and 128 MiB of decoder allocations.
The size ladder is 32, 64, 128, 256, 368, 512, 720, 1024, 1440, 2048, 2880, and 4096.
The requested rung is never longer than the file.
Inline stills keep 384 images and 96 MiB.
Inline animations keep 96 clips and 128 MiB.
One inline clip keeps 240 frames and 40 MiB.
The viewer lane keeps 128 MiB and drops those pixels on the first frame the viewer is not painted.
One viewer clip keeps 240 frames and 96 MiB.
An animation that exceeds 600 frames or 3 seconds of decoding stays on its first frame.
A gifv clip the platform decoder rejects is not retried; the embed shows its GIF or poster.
GIF, WebP, and ISO-BMFF clips share that frame budget.
Animation source dimensions are capped at 2048×2048, with a 48 MiB decoder allocation
budget for the persistent RGBA canvas, current frame and composited output canvas.
Resized retained frames, encoded input and library overhead are additional.
Active decoding, image conversion, and framework or driver allocations are additional.
Avatar and emoji textures stay on their existing caches.
Message pictures use the still, animation, and viewer ceilings above.
Animation texture uploads are spaced at least 34 ms apart (under 30 FPS), with
source timing preserved by skipping frames; unfocused windows do not advance clips.
These are component ceilings, not measured whole-process RSS. Disk eviction retains only
32 candidate paths at a time. Worker completion fences replacement and deletion, so
logout/clear cannot race an older worker's writes. Picture-cache failures appear in
local-storage status. Disk cache contents are unencrypted. Category collapse is retained in the
account-isolated channel preferences record. Narrow People overlays and outer window geometry
remain session-local.

Storage commands and results each retain their 16-item limit and have separate 16 MiB
estimated allocation budgets. Reservations include vector/string capacity and metadata
allowances and are released when work/results are consumed or dropped. Byte exhaustion
rejects command admission through the existing unsaved/cleanup handling; the storage worker
waits for result capacity without dropping completions. One completed result awaiting
admission and the SQLite working set are additional. History payloads retain the 500-row /
4 MiB limit. A connection-local byte total avoids rescanning all history on each save;
SQLite write/version counters invalidate it after other writes. The disk schema and
transactional eviction limits are unchanged.

Each remote-video decoder queue admits at most 64 access units and 16 MiB of allocated
encoded capacity, including the access unit being decoded. Exhaustion uses the existing
frame-drop/keyframe-recovery path. At most 16 reassemblers retain partial access units
of 2 MiB + 64 KiB each; discarded partials release capacities above 256 KiB. Decoder,
reference-picture, hardware and displayed-frame memory are additional. The synchronous
software-video sink borrows the reusable RGBA buffer, avoiding a full-frame clone before
conversion to UI pixels. No live media was used to establish these implementation bounds.

Voice introduces no application audio files, recordings or voice-key store. Device preferences are saved locally as described above. Voice tokens/session IDs use redacted, zeroizing buffers and never enter SQLite or diagnostics; DAVE identities are regenerated for a new call. Eight-frame PCM queues, bounded Opus packets and one bounded decoder/jitter/PCM working set per remote speaker (up to 63) are transient media allocations, not disk caches. Guild voice rosters are session-only with 4,096-entry and 1 MiB budgets; they are never persisted. Upstream cryptographic tracing is compiled out. Audio-device shutdown is fenced before another device session starts. Synthetic crypto, transport and device-free capture-gate tests passed; actual audio-driver/permission artifacts and process writes during a physical call have not been traced. OS microphone permissions and driver behavior are outside Serein's cache-clearing guarantee.

The optional READY voice-user lookup and per-snapshot/passive-update member lookup each admit
at most 4,096 unique nonzero users / 1 MiB of estimated model storage, checking before insertion.
Duplicate or excess metadata is discarded rather than ending login. These estimates use the
existing user/member storage accounting and exclude BTreeMap node overhead. Missing identities
use the existing participant-ID fallback. READY users are cleared after READY_SUPPLEMENTAL,
disconnect or session reset; member lookups are temporary. Disconnected states and channels not
admitted for voice do not consume the actual roster's count budget. The 4 MiB wire bound and
the actual roster's 4,096-entry / 1 MiB bounds are unchanged; no new disk storage is introduced.

Image attachment metadata remains bounded by 10 attachments / 64 KiB retained metadata and 256 KiB JSON per message, including original/proxy signed URLs. It counts toward existing window, pending-patch and database budgets. Decoded pixels reuse the shared media worker/cache; spoiler attachments are not requested before explicit reveal. Profile metadata (bio, pronouns, badges, connections and mutual-server summaries) stays in the single bounded RAM view. Profile and server-specific banner/avatar pixels may remain in the shared account image cache after closing the profile; cache clear/logout removes them under the same policy.

Explicit Download creates an original attachment file only at the user-selected location. Suggested filenames are sanitized; downloads never reinterpret message filenames as destination paths, follow redirects, or send credentials to the CDN. Existing regular files are replaced only after native Save confirmation and a complete, flushed transfer. A new destination is published without overwriting a file created meanwhile. The one worker closes/removes its sibling partial on cancellation or failure; cleanup failures are visible. Forced termination or a filesystem error can leave a `.serein-*.partial` sibling, and macOS, Linux and Windows publish new files with exclusive native moves so hard-link support is not required. Normal close waits for the active worker; a cancelled native dialog must still be dismissed. Downloads are explicit user files, not account cache entries, and survive logout/cache clearing. Limits and transfer bounds are strictly enforced.

Conversation search queries and result snippets are session-only, limited to one 25-result / 256 KiB page and a 256-character query. Neither is written to SQLite or diagnostics. Opening a result uses normal bounded history retrieval, whose revalidated messages can enter the existing account cache.

Archived-thread pages share the same exclusive read/result slot with search and pins. At most 25 channel summaries / 64 KiB are retained from a response capped at 512 KiB; member payloads are ignored. Request/next cursors are fixed-size timestamps or IDs. Pages and cursors are not persisted. Opening admits one transient channel within existing account item/byte navigation limits, then uses ordinary bounded history caching. Leaving retires transient navigation, not saved drafts or cached history; explicit revocation still invalidates inaccessible content. No archive directory cache, background paging or added worker queue exists.

Pinned-message summaries share search's single session-only 25-item / 64 KiB result slot and 512 KiB response limit. Manual older-page navigation replaces that slot instead of accumulating results; two optional fixed-size timestamp cursors track the request and next page. Failed older requests can be retried deliberately, with no background retry. Opening a result uses ordinary bounded history caching; pin snapshots/cursors are not written to SQLite. PR screenshots are synthetic development evidence and are excluded from packaged documentation.

Uploads do not persist local source paths, signed staging targets or file bytes. Pending filename/size labels remain bounded session metadata; existing recovery drafts retain only composed text, so retrying an attachment requires selecting the source again. Files are opened for reading and checked for observable size/modification changes; this is not an immutable snapshot guarantee. Cancellation stops the local job, but bytes already uploaded to Discord staging may remain there without a created message; no remote cleanup or retention guarantee is claimed. Completed messages and their returned attachment metadata can enter the existing bounded history cache. The OS file picker may retain OS-managed recent-location history. No new application log or hidden upload recovery store is introduced.

Twemoji artwork is public bundled data, not an account cache: one 5,225,108-byte PNG
and a fixed 4,009-entry Unicode index are embedded in the executable. A startup worker
decodes one 2,048×2,016 RGBA atlas (15.75 MiB); the GPU texture has the same pixel
payload, with driver overhead additional. The decoder writes directly into the final
CPU pixel buffer and premultiplies alpha in place; decoder scratch and upload staging
can add temporary storage. The context retains the single atlas until exit,
including across logout; there are no emoji downloads, disk writes, or growing texture
queues. Unknown sequences and explicit text-presentation selectors remain font text.

GIF search and trending results retain at most eight session-memory pages / 768 KiB for ten
minutes. Reopening a fresh query reuses its page without a REST request; least-recently-used
pages are evicted first and logout clears the cache. This cache is account-session scoped and
is not written to SQLite. GIF favorites remain account-isolated SQLite metadata, capped at 100
entries; their validated preview images reuse the account image disk cache described above and
are removed by the same clear-cache/logout paths.

Custom server emoji catalogs live only in session navigation memory: at most 1,000 entries
and 256 KiB allocated data per server, including names and role lists, within the shared
4 MiB navigation budget. Reconnect READY replaces catalogs; full emoji-update events replace
a server catalog; deletion clears it and old session generations cannot repopulate it.
No catalog table or schema migration is added. Custom PNG previews reuse the existing
account-isolated image worker/disk cache and its 256-texture / 64 MiB GPU working set, request
and retry limits, 512 KiB icon decode input and 128×128 decoded dimension cap. They use
validated numeric `emoji-ID` keys and credential-free Discord CDN PNG requests (64px static
preview), never arbitrary URLs or automatic animation. Cache clear/logout follows the existing
image-cache policy. Synthetic IDs 9001/9002 only get local generated images in `--demo`.
The standard picker palette has 3,953 fixed named entries and renders only viewport rows;
search input is capped at 64 characters. Picker insertion honors character and total draft
capacity limits and never sends a message on selection.

Custom emoji search retains at most 1,000 guild/emoji index pairs (16,000 bytes on
64-bit targets), plus at most 256 UTF-8 query bytes and fixed scope metadata. It
borrows current catalog entries only while rendering. State revision, session,
account, selected server and query changes invalidate results; navigation/session
reset releases the cache. No catalog strings or image pixels are duplicated.


Channel obfuscation and accepted READY removals invalidate inaccessible history using the existing
account-wide ClearHistory operation; readable-to-unsupported channel changes count as removal.
This deliberately trades a broader history refetch for no new per-channel deletion API. Cache
hydration requires the current request, a pending empty loading view, a loaded text channel and
matching message channel IDs. Late disk/HTTP responses cannot refill a revoked view. Drafts remain
available for recovery. This does not erase explicit downloaded files or promise deletion of
already requested image pixels, OS artifacts or remote attachment staging data. No schema,
persistent visibility list, new worker queue or credential storage is introduced.

The permission mirror is session-only and never enters SQLite, credentials or diagnostics.
It retains at most 4,000 guild/channel records, 16,384 guild roles and 32,768 overwrites;
per guild/member role lists stop at 512, per-channel wire overwrites at 1,000. Other members'
overwrite entries are validated then discarded; all role overwrite entries remain so later
self-role changes can be calculated. A 2 MiB estimated allocation budget includes reserved
space for at least 4,000 cached decisions. Updates clone the bounded metadata for atomic
validation; that temporary copy is additional peak memory. These estimates are not process
RSS. Decisions expire at timeout boundaries, are recomputed after clock rollback and are
cleared on metadata updates. Logout/READY replace the session mirror.

Current VIEW and READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY are required for HTTP/cache admission and history
persistence. Read-access loss, including thread parent/type changes, queues the existing
account-wide ClearHistory operation. Sending-only permission changes do not erase cached
history. VIEW-only live messages stay in the bounded RAM timeline without being persisted.
Existing recovery drafts and explicitly downloaded files keep their documented lifecycle.
No schema change or external runtime dependency is added; UI tests reuse the existing
workspace test-support crate through a dev-dependency.

Notification/read activity and remote notification preferences remain bounded session RAM only;
the local notification choice is saved in `app_preferences` and defaults to on for new installs.
When enabled, message alerts send a
bounded sender name and message preview to the OS; an already-cached local avatar PNG may also
be used. Other alert kinds remain generic. The OS may keep its own notification/permission history.
Logout invalidates queued work and requests dismissal; this does not erase OS records.
See notification limits and platform behavior. Composer artwork uses
the existing Twemoji atlas and custom-image cache; saved drafts keep their original wire
text, with no extra rendered-token storage.


Loaded People presence is session-only within the existing 100-row / 128-KiB member mirror.
The Gateway additionally holds at most 100 pending IDs and complete normalized presence values
(each at most seven status bytes plus 128 characters / 512 bytes of custom text), plus bounded
BTreeMap node overhead. An emitted compact batch is limited to 100 entries / 64 KiB including allocated vector/string capacity and uses the existing
bounded event queue. Wire decoding keeps the existing 4-MiB cap, consumes at most 16 activities
one at a time (state <=4096 bytes, emoji name <=128 bytes), and drops unrelated fields.
Presence growth is checked against the member budget before mutation. Full snapshots and
subscription/session invalidation clear pending status batches. No presence, activity or client
device history is saved to SQLite, logs or diagnostics; status-only changes do not persist chat
history or invalidate timeline layout. These are component bounds, not process RSS measurements.


The conversation switcher retains only its open-state flags, focused control ID and a query of
at most 128 characters / 512 UTF-8 bytes. Each open frame builds at most 20 labels from bounded
channel/guild and retained friend names; each field is limited to 128 characters. Those 20 rows
may temporarily clone their already-retained direct/friend profile so the shared bounded avatar
cache can render it; no separate image cache or request queue is added. Matching
normalizes one eligible channel's bounded names and at most 64 known DM recipients' names,
nicknames and usernames at a time, then drops them. Friend matching reuses the bounded relationship
map; a temporary set of at most 4,000 fixed-size friend IDs prevents duplicate one-to-one results.
Opening a missing DM uses the existing single pending user action and bounded write queue, a
64 KiB response limit, normal navigation admission limits and one fixed-size navigation target.
It adds no persistent query history, search index or directory fetch. Closing clears the query;
logout resets the UI and pending target.

## September 10: message type retention

Schema 7 adds one checked integer `message_kind` (0..255) per cached message, with no new payload or cache. Existing unsupported rows migrate to the unknown sentinel 255; ordinary rows use 0. Reloaded history supplies the actual type. Existing account/item/byte/page limits remain in force. Migration and reopen/roundtrip tests cover retained rows and invalid values. Builds limited to schema 6 cannot reopen this cache. PR #28 independently uses schema 7 for content markers; merge both column-detected migrations and both save/load fields when integrating these branches.


### Opt-in synchronization and compatibility diagnostics

Voice performance diagnostics (`SEREIN_VOICE_DIAGNOSTICS=1`) are also off by default.
They retain at most eight fixed-size numeric reports in a worker queue (under 2 KiB),
plus one report per producer and one being written. One background writer formats
reports and caps attempted stderr output at 8,192 reports AND 8 MiB per process,
across calls (about eleven hours of three concurrent five-second reporters). Queue overflow drops diagnostics without delaying media. A blocked
stderr can stall only that single diagnostic writer. No files, identifiers, device
names, payloads, audio, keys or telemetry are produced. Explicit shell redirection
is owner-managed; unrelated output and appended runs are outside these limits.
See [voice CPU diagnostics](voice.md#investigating-high-cpu-during-a-call) for usage.

`SEREIN_MEMBER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` enables fixed-label member synchronization diagnostics;
`SEREIN_GATEWAY_DIAGNOSTICS=1` enables Gateway compatibility diagnostics. Both are off by default.
Each enabled scope has a hard budget of 64 attempted records AND 8 KiB of formatted UTF-8
output per Gateway run, shared across reconnect attempts. The desktop adds at most one
fixed-label terminal session-failure line per enabled scope (less than 256 bytes). Failed or
partial writes consume the attempted record's budget; a closed stderr never fails the session.
No diagnostic strings, raw events, queue, archive, database entries or telemetry are retained.

Member labels distinguish subscription/cancellation, empty or populated SYNC, identity mismatch,
decode/range/capacity failure and timeout. Gateway labels distinguish an unsupported dispatch,
a missing/empty dispatch name, and an unsupported opcode that stops the connection. Unsupported
dispatches continue to be ignored and grant no capabilities. The diagnostic deliberately cannot
identify the exact unknown service event: even its received name is excluded, along with payloads,
credentials, account/channel/list IDs, usernames, message content and signed URLs.

Output goes only to stderr. Serein creates no log file; explicit shell redirection is owner-managed
and can also capture unrelated framework output, to which these limits do not apply. Repeated
application runs appended to one external file are not bounded by a single Gateway-run budget.
Windows GUI builds may have no inherited stderr; launch with deliberate stderr redirection to
capture diagnostics. Do not use a real owner session in default tests. Synthetic tests check
redaction, UTF-8 byte/line limits, disabled and broken-output cases, and message delivery plus
heartbeat sequencing after unsupported dispatches. No live interoperability claim follows.

### Existing DM call presence

Session memory keeps at most 64 ongoing one-to-one or group DM channel IDs (512 bytes of ID storage,
plus the Vec header), independently of the active local media session and incoming ringing.
Alongside those IDs, at most 64 call rosters retain 64 fixed-size Participant slots each
(65,536 participant bytes on 64-bit targets, plus vector/channel headers). These contain
only user IDs and mute/deafen/video/streaming flags. No voice secrets, audio or new disk
entries are retained for this list.
Duplicate updates reuse an entry; at capacity, the oldest entry is evicted. Opening a DM
requests its call state again through the bounded existing command/signaling queues. There
is no background polling or all-DM subscription. Deletion/unavailability or channel removal
clears the matching entry; fresh READY, resync and logout clear the list. A resumable
disconnect retains it for replay, with Join disabled until Gateway connectivity returns.



The reliable Gateway/HTTP-to-UI queue accepts one bounded navigation refresh burst
(up to MAX_NAV + EVENT_SLOTS = 4,008 items) within the existing 32 MiB aggregate estimated
envelope/permit byte budget. Each event remains capped at 4 MiB. Receiving or dropping an
envelope releases its permits; full/oversized admission still fails visibly. The UI drains
eight reliable events per frame and repaints only while work remains. This fixes normal
GUILD_CREATE channel fanout exceeding the old eight-item queue; it does not enlarge the
byte budget or silently discard reliable events. These are component limits, not RSS.

Member role display reuses session-only permission metadata: at most 512 roles per guild,
16,384 across the mirror, within its existing byte budget. Each name retains at most 100
non-control characters; owned string capacities count toward both event and mirror budgets.
Member rows retain at most 512 role IDs, bounded while decoding and checked at state admission;
their vector capacities count toward the existing active-pane byte bound. No role directory,
new cache, persistent schema, or network endpoint is introduced.

Unread/forward navigation reuses the cancellable history worker, 50-message response limit,
500-row/4-MiB active timeline and existing global resident budget. Loaded unread boundaries
scroll locally; unloaded boundaries replace the selected window, and forward pages append
within its bounds, preserving deletion/reconciliation metadata and drafts. Three fixed-size
cursor fields and a full-page flag are session-only. Forward-target pages are not restored
from the SQLite latest-page cache or parked in the resident recent-window cache. Accepted
message metadata remains subject to ordinary account history persistence; no new cache,
queue, directory fetch or background pagination is introduced.


Role/everyone/silent notification fields are session-only message-arrival metadata. Up to 100
unique positive role IDs and 800 retained role-vector bytes are admitted per message, charged
by allocated capacity in Message/Event/timeline budgets. SQLite restoration supplies empty/false
notification fields; reading history never generates an alert. No schema change is needed.
Queued notifications retain role IDs and direct/everyone provenance to recheck delivery, within
the existing 32-item/16-KiB ceiling including unused deque slots. Observed badge records remain
4096 fixed entries/128 KiB, without retaining role arrays. No additional cache or queue exists.


### Received activity metadata (September 10, 2026)

Rich presence stays in RAM: up to four activities per user, each name/details/state field
128 characters / 512 bytes. Custom status retains its separate 128-character / 512-byte limit.
Active member rows share the existing 128 KiB pane budget. Known DM recipients additionally
use a FIFO cache of at most 256 records / 512 KiB including vector storage and owned strings.
Gateway updates coalesce for 100 ms, at most 100 users / 128 KiB per batch. Initial friends are
filtered to the first 256 known DM recipient IDs and emitted in bounded batches. Unknown users
are never retained in the core cache. Disconnect hides cached DM presence until successful
resume; fresh READY, resync, failure and logout discard it. Removed recipients are pruned.
Two optional artwork references per activity are retained (primary and badge): each contains
two asset IDs, one application ID, or a Discord media-proxy path of at most 1,024 bytes. Their
enum/vector storage and allocated path capacities count toward the same presence budgets.
An optional start timestamp uses Unix milliseconds bounded to the existing RPC safe-integer
limit; it remains session-only. Secrets, buttons and raw event payloads are
discarded. Images needed by the visible profile share the existing credential-free image worker,
256-texture / 64-MiB texture cache and account-isolated 1-GiB / 4,096-file / 90-day disk cache.
Application-icon metadata responses are capped at 64 KiB and discarded after validating the
application ID and icon hash; only the decoded-valid PNG enters the disk cache. Application icons
cached by application ID can remain stale until normal cache expiry or clear-cache. Proxy keys
use the existing SHA-256 disk filenames. No new cache, schema or dependency is introduced.
### Native font fallback (egui main experiment)

Eframe `system_fonts` enumerates installed fonts on a background thread and uses
read-only memory-mapped OS font files for missing glyphs, including native color
emoji. No font download or font-file copy is added. Upstream fallback can wait
for enumeration on its first missing glyph; its font/cache memory is framework
overhead, separate from Serein message/image budgets. OS font availability and
emoji coverage vary by platform. Bundled text faces and Twemoji remain in use.


### Inline MP3/WAV preview (September 11, 2026)

A deliberate Play action starts one lazy output-only worker. One replaceable request
retains bounded validated attachment URL metadata; no account credential is sent.
The credential-free downloader refuses redirects and content encoding and requires
the declared length, capped at 20 MiB with a 60-second deadline. Audio stays in RAM:
at most 64 MiB of decoded f32 samples and ten minutes, mono/stereo at 8?96 kHz,
plus bounded decoder/transport buffers. PCM vector reallocation may temporarily
retain old and new allocations (up to roughly 128 MiB combined), separately from
the encoded buffer, decoder, audio device and process overhead. MP3 ID3 tags are skipped without decoding;
WAV metadata is removed before demuxing. No media files or playback preferences
are persisted. Playback stops when its card leaves view, the attachment changes,
the conversation changes, the window is minimized/occluded, or the session ends.
An atomic generation gate mutes obsolete output; the single worker releases its
stream/buffers on cancellation. Pausing retains the current bounded decoded clip.

## Screen sharing

Screen/window labels, selected source identifiers, settings, raw pixels and encoded video exist only in session memory. They are not written to SQLite, diagnostics, previews or video files. Sources and video queues use the limits in [screen-sharing compatibility](discord-compatibility.md#outgoing-screen-sharing--september-11-2026). Stream credentials and DAVE identities are ephemeral and redacted; the signing key is shared with the active voice call and zeroized when its final owner drops. Native OS/driver capture surfaces are distinct from application-owned frame buffers. Synthetic PR screenshots are development evidence, excluded from runtime assets.

Outgoing packet pacing retains the already packetized access unit across transport turns,
at most 2,048 packets of 1,200 wire bytes each, instead of sending it in one uninterrupted
loop. It does not admit another access unit until the pending one drains; DAVE transitions
discard the pending packets. The existing three-frame capture queue remains unchanged.

Outgoing RTX separately retains at most 2,048 original DAVE-encrypted packets for one
second, with a 2 MiB cap accounting for payload capacities and occupied entry metadata.
The bounded deque's spare metadata slots are additional, as are 128 pending u16 sequence
numbers (256 bytes). Rekeys and teardown clear both. No plaintext-frame copy, persistent
cache or recording is added. Feedback holds at most 128 NACK numbers per authenticated
4 KiB datagram; rate control retains fixed-size counters and one atomic encoder target.


### Own game activity (September 11, 2026)

Linked Spotify playback is independent of this local game toggle. One cancellable worker
reads the linked connection preference and playback on a 15-second interval while visible.
Connection and playback responses are capped at 64 KiB, token responses at 16 KiB;
at most 64 connections, 64 artists and eight album images are accepted. Only five artists
contribute to the bounded display string. One track is retained in replaceable watch/Gateway
slots, with title/artist/album text capped at 128 characters each, a 22-character track ID,
40-hex artwork ID and fixed timestamps. There is no playback history or new disk cache.
The Spotify bearer is private, zeroizing session RAM (8 KiB maximum), never serialized to disk
or diagnostics, and sent only to fixed `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player` with a sensitive
header. Redirects, proxies and automatic HTTP retries are disabled. Invisible/session teardown
drops the bearer; unlinking clears it on the next poll. The existing album-image cache applies.

Sharing is off by default. The application-wide `game_activity` SQLite singleton stores
one constrained boolean; disabling deletes the override. The independent additive table
is created even for existing schema-10/12 databases, requires no message migration, and survives
account logout like appearance. A failed load stays off; failed writes are visible in settings.
Preview controls never load or save this preference.

While enabled in an authenticated connection, Serein owns one standard Discord IPC endpoint
and at most eight connected game workers. Windows uses a current-user-only pipe DACL and
rejects remote connections; Unix uses a 0600 socket and checks peer UID. Occupied paths are
never replaced or unlinked. Unix removes only its own device/inode on teardown; Windows
explicitly disconnects clients, including blocked writers. No process enumeration remains.
The handshake returns only the current user ID/name and empty legacy avatar/discriminator
fields; no token, chat, account-read, authentication, call or microphone API is exposed.

Each client frame is capped at 16 KiB before allocation. Replies assemble one temporary
buffer capped at 16 KiB plus the eight-byte header per writing client, released after the
write completes or is cancelled. The handshake timeout is 10 seconds,
partial-frame and write deadlines are five seconds. Idle clients do not poll. At most one
new client is admitted per five seconds; each client processes at most ten frames per second.
A 16-item update queue carries activities bounded to 1,152 string bytes plus fixed fields;
eight latest per-client activities and the Gateway current/last values have the same bound.
The latest updated connected game wins; clearing/disconnecting it restores another active game.

The UI report retains that game's name/details/state (at most 384 UTF-8 bytes), two optional
fixed-size registered artwork/application references and its optional start timestamp.
The state owner keeps one validated
local display activity capped at 4 KiB of retained heap. Profile cards and member rows
borrow it for the current account, without copying it into remote presence caches.
It is not persisted and is cleared on sharing/game/session teardown. Equal reports do
not invalidate the timeline; changed details/artwork repaint even when the name is unchanged.

Each connection lazily requests public application metadata and registered assets once, using
credential-free HTTPS with redirects/proxies disabled and ten-second request deadlines.
A shared lookup mutex serializes requests and preserves Retry-After cooldowns across clients.
Responses are capped at 256 KiB, asset lists at 1,024 entries with 256-byte names. These are
session RAM only (up to eight lists), not disk caches. Missing artwork is omitted; name lookup
failure clears that connection and reports an error. Game-supplied URLs, secrets, buttons and
join/party actions are never forwarded. There is no activity history or telemetry.

Disabling sharing cancels the listener, clients and metadata work and queues an empty Gateway
activity; publication including clears remains subject to the existing five-second interval.
Connection teardown cancels IPC with the authenticated session. Demo mode never binds IPC or
looks up metadata. The saved boolean and database schema are unchanged.


### Tray and account activity privacy (September 11, 2026)

The tray preference defaults on. The existing independent `minimize_to_tray`
singleton table stores an explicit integer and survives restart/logout; demo toggles
are memory-only. No account data is added to the tray or its menu.

Windows/macOS keep their native icon adapters. Linux owns one cancellable ksni
StatusNotifierItem on the application's Tokio runtime, one bundled 32×32 ARGB icon
(4096 bytes), and a fixed atomic bitset coalescing Show/Minimize/Quit/failure events.
Registration and its host recheck each time out after three seconds; teardown waits
at most two seconds. There is no polling/retry loop or persisted tray history.
Disabling or host loss restores a hidden window; retry requires toggling the setting.
Flatpak grants only the additional `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` talk permission,
not blanket session-bus access. No Discord identifiers, presence or secrets enter D-Bus.

Close keeps the process running only with an available tray. X11 supports hiding;
native Wayland receives a compositor-controlled minimize request and is not falsely
marked hidden. Show and Quit restore first; Quit defers to a UI pass so existing
unsaved-work and cleanup checks can run. Cancelling Quit restores close-to-tray behavior.

While local game sharing is enabled, one cancellable account-settings operation reads
Discord's actual sharing preference. A one-slot request channel permits an explicit
refresh or enable action; a fixed-size watch result carries completion. Only the
explicit Enable on Discord action can write the account preference. The existing
1 MiB response limit and 4,096-field protobuf parser apply; the retained status
subtree is capped at 16 KiB and discarded after each request. No raw settings are
logged or saved. Server activity diagnostics borrow at most 64 KiB / 16 sessions /
16 activities per list and retain only a fixed enum, never session identities or
raw presence payloads. Connection teardown clears these reports and workers.

### Account menu presence (September 12, 2026)

The account status and custom status are Discord settings (`settings-proto/1`,
status field). Serein reads them before gateway identify, so a launch does not
force Online, and writes that field again when the owner changes them. The
gateway still publishes one replaceable watch value. One local row per account
(`account_presence`: status, custom text at most 512 bytes, optional expiry) is
the fallback when that read fails, and logout removes it with the account.
Schema 22 adds the table. Older clients cannot open it. The
editor retains one draft capped at 128 Unicode characters (512 UTF-8 bytes).
There is no status history. Demo changes never publish, persist, or call Discord.

### Inline attachment video

Native video decoding is memory-only. One lazy worker handles the latest requested attachment,
with a replaceable pending request and cancellation fencing. The network source retains
up to eight 256 KiB ranges (2 MiB, including an in-flight range); responses are checked for exact range/total/body lengths and reject
redirects and content encoding. Encoded attachment size is capped at 100 MiB.
The application queues at most two 1080p RGBA frames, one replaceable display frame,
one UI texture, one second of stereo float PCM (at most 768,000 bytes), and one decoded
audio packet plus at most two seconds of timestamp-gap silence. Each native decoded
sample is rejected above 16 MiB before copying. OS decoder/GPU allocations are additional
and are released with the player. No file cache or media URL/byte diagnostics are written.


### Friends overview

The friends page reuses the bounded relationship store (4,000 friends / 2 MiB)
and the existing presence cache (256 records / 512 KiB), now admitting known
unblocked friends as well as DM recipients. Blocked and ignored relationship profiles
have a separate 4,000-item / 2 MiB session-only bound and are cleared on logout.
Startup presence admission keeps its 256-user bound. Presence outside retained/received
data stays unavailable. The UI retains only a 128-character search and bounded derived
ID lists, renders visible 64-point rows, and reuses the avatar cache and existing user
actions. No disk storage, network endpoint or friend-management write is added.

### Opt-in Windows startup

General settings can register this executable for the current Windows user's sign-in,
off by default. The sole source of truth is the `Serein` REG_SZ value under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`: a quoted absolute
executable path with `--autostart` and optionally `--start-minimized`, at most 260
UTF-16 code units plus its terminator. It contains no account data or credentials.
Turning startup off removes only this value. It survives logout; moving the portable
executable requires enabling startup again from its new location. Windows Startup Apps
can independently block the entry; Serein does not override that OS decision.
One off-thread operation and one fixed-size completion may exist at a time. Failed
writes restore the last known setting and display an error. Demo mode does not read
or write the startup entry. Automatic launches use the existing saved-login behavior;
ordinary manual launches remain visible even when Start Serein minimized is selected.

### Account-type badges (schema 14)

Cached messages retain one checked `account_kind` integer: 0 (ordinary/unknown), 1 (bot),
2 (explicit application-generated author). The existing independent `webhook` marker
continues to control webhook profile behavior. Migration adds the column transactionally;
legacy messages default to 0 until service history refreshes, without guessing from names.
Unknown stored values are rejected. No new table, cache, queue, payload collection or
network request is introduced; account, item, byte and page limits remain unchanged.
Older schema-13 clients cannot reopen a schema-14 cache. User metadata serialized in
bounded existing caches defaults missing kinds to ordinary/unknown.

Message delete protector is opt-in and session-only. Retained deleted payloads share
the existing 500-row / 4 MiB timeline limit and resident-history budget. They are
excluded from normal message iteration, service actions and disk cache writes.
Disabling the plugin, logout, lost channel access or eviction releases the payloads.
The usual disk-cache deletion still runs when a deletion arrives.


### Server role editor

One in-memory role catalog is retained for the open guild: at most 512 roles,
512 KiB including allocated string/vector capacity, and 256 bounded feature names.
There is one UI draft and one server-administration request at a time; role-member
search reuses the existing bounded member page. Unknown role permission bits are
retained and edits carry a changed-bit mask. Closing settings/logout releases the
editor state; no new database table or persistent role cache is added.

Role icon preparation reuses the off-thread image worker, bounded source input and
PNG data URI limits. Its preview is at most 128 by 128 pixels; the completion is
scoped to account generation, guild, role and picker request. The retained core
request drops the image payload. CDN role icons share the existing bounded image
cache and are confined to a validated numeric role ID and icon hash.

### Server invite settings

One active guild invite snapshot uses the existing in-memory administration lane:
at most 1,000 invites and 1 MiB including allocated strings/vector capacity, with
at most 256 feature names and 100 assigned role IDs per invite. REST bodies are
limited to 2 MiB (64 KiB for a revoke response). Larger responses fail visibly;
they are not silently truncated. Codes and inviter metadata are released when
settings close, access is lost or the account resets. No invite database, logs,
background collection or automatic write retry is added. Create Invite retains
the existing bounded, session-only invite dialog behavior.


Server and channel integration settings share one on-demand metadata snapshot in
session RAM, scoped either to one guild or to one channel in that guild:
at most 50 integrations and 1,000 webhooks, further bounded by 1 MiB combined.
The HTTP decoder caps each list response at 2 MiB and write responses at 64 KiB
(4 KiB for empty delete responses). List decoding skips webhook execution tokens
and URLs. Explicit URL copying uses one 64 KiB authenticated response and a
256-byte URL-safe token in a zeroizing, redacted, one-shot clipboard handoff.
Navigation, disconnect, permission changes and settings closure discard that
handoff; the OS clipboard receives it only after the explicit copy request.
The editor retains one bounded
80-character/320-byte webhook name draft; no integration data or draft is written
to SQLite. Closing settings, changing guild/session, and permission revocation
release the applicable metadata. Existing bounded avatar caches remain shared.

### Messaging permissions

The account preference snapshot stays in session RAM, with at most 4,096 IDs in
each of two guild lists (64 KiB combined allocated ID storage). A single pending
update uses the existing command queue; bulk changes carry at most 4,096 IDs
(32 KiB). HTTP responses are capped at 1 MiB and preserved protobuf subtrees at
128 KiB each. Disconnect, resync and account reset invalidate the snapshot and
pending request. No preferences or raw settings payloads are saved to SQLite or logs.

### Server audit log

One active guild audit view retains at most 500 entries, 1,000 referenced users
and 2 MiB of metadata in session RAM. Each on-demand response has at most 50
entries and 100 users within 1 MiB decoded metadata; HTTP input is capped at
2 MiB. Changes are bounded display values with explicit absent/null states,
not retained arbitrary JSON. Individual values, nesting and per-entry change
counts are limited before admission. Filters replace the current history;
closing settings, switching guild/session and permission loss release it.
No audit log, filter or expansion state is saved to SQLite or diagnostic logs.
The shared bounded avatar cache is reused.

### Application updates

The existing device-wide `app_preferences` JSON stores `auto_update` (default false)
and `update_nightly` (default true). Missing fields in older settings use those
defaults; the existing 16 KiB row bound still applies. These preferences survive
account logout. Update checks wait for preferences to load; demo actions remain
in memory and never open update transports or create installation files.

The updater uses a separate credential-free HTTPS client for the Serein GitHub
release repository. It keeps one worker/result slot, at most 2 MiB of release
metadata, a 64 KiB checksum list and one streamed archive capped at 512 MiB.
Progress is coalesced into one atomic byte counter; release bodies, URLs and
package contents never enter application diagnostics or account caches.
The ZIP central directory is checked before allocation (4 MiB / 8,192 entries);
ZIP64 packages are rejected. Extracted data is capped at 1 GiB. Paths, duplicate
names, symlinks and special files are validated before writing to private staging
beside the installation. Staging records the app/helper owner and is reused or
cleaned before another download; backups from interrupted replacements are kept
for recovery and block another installation instead of being deleted.

Linux AppImages reuse the same 512 MiB streamed download/checksum limit and private
sibling staging. Their Type 2 ELF header and x86-64 architecture are checked without
executing the download. The image is not unpacked; restart atomically replaces the
original AppImage path and retains a hard-linked backup until the replacement
survives its initial two-second launch check. This detects immediate launch failure,
not application health or a successful login. Interrupted backups block subsequent
updates for manual recovery. Native Linux packages remain package-manager managed.

AppImage delta updates optionally read a SHA-256-verified `.zsync` control file
capped at 16 MiB (4 KiB headers), with at most 262,144 block records. The local seed
and reconstructed image each retain the 512 MiB limit. A streaming scan uses a
1 MiB buffer plus at most 64 KiB overlap, bounded checksum indexes, a 15-second
scan limit and at most 1 GiB of block hashing. Up to 128 coalesced ranges use the
existing credential-free HTTPS client with a 120-second transfer deadline.
Metadata URLs and filenames never control requests or filesystem paths. MD4 only
matches legacy zsync blocks; release SHA-256 verifies both metadata and the final
image. Failed delta staging is removed before the full-download fallback; user
cancellation does not start a fallback. No account data or new persistent cache
is involved. Progress includes locally reused bytes.

### Thread participant snapshots — September 15, 2026

The People pane shares its existing 100-member / 128-KiB metadata limit with
on-demand thread participant snapshots. One Gateway subscription uses a 512-KiB
wire cap; results use the existing bounded event queue. Replacing or closing the
member view unsubscribes from the previous thread. Session/request/channel and
view-permission checks fence late results. No member snapshots, cursors or payloads
are persisted, and no background pagination or new queue is introduced.

### Opt-in macOS startup

The existing startup worker writes only
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/cz.viceverse.serein.startup.plist`, at most 16 KiB,
with an absolute executable path and fixed autostart/minimized flags. Reads are
bounded to 16 KiB; unknown or moved entries report an error. Enabling atomically
replaces this file using a private sibling temporary file; disabling removes it.
No account data, credentials or separate preference is stored. The entry runs once
at the next graphical login; it has no KeepAlive or immediate launch. Demo mode
keeps startup changes in memory. OS login-item restrictions remain authoritative.


### Per-participant voice volume

The UI lazily retains one fixed 64-slot table of user IDs and integer percentages
(1,024 bytes of entry storage). The voice watch control holds one fixed table of the same
size, copied by the transport for a tick; changes replace the existing control value without
adding a queue. Values are clamped to 0–200 before mixing. A full UI table replaces its first
retained entry; reset releases a slot. Logout/preview reset clears the table. No SQLite,
credential-store, network setting write, or diagnostics payload is added.
Chat author role IDs travel with the cached message window (at most 512 IDs per
message, 16 KiB JSON). They count toward the existing timeline and 48 MiB history
budgets. Names use the current guild role catalog. Live member rows refresh the
color only when they carry role IDs; an empty live row keeps the message snapshot
so cached history can paint colors with the conversation.

Chat author guild nicknames are cached with that window, capped at 128 Unicode
characters / 512 UTF-8 bytes. Live member rows win only when they carry a
nickname. Missing membership keeps the stored nick or the usual name.

Custom emoji artwork shares the existing account-isolated image disk cache
(4,096 files / 1 GiB, 90-day inactivity retention). Its GPU working set is separate
from avatars and media, bounded to 1,024 textures / 16 MiB with least-recently-used
eviction. Evicted textures reload from disk when available.

Visible chat author lookups retain a second session-only member snapshot, capped
at 100 members / 128 KiB, with at most 100 requested user IDs. It shares the
mention transport's 512-KiB payload cap, rate limit and bounded event queue.
Channel/session changes fence late results; session reset releases the snapshot.
No author lookup results are persisted and no complete guild directory is fetched.

On macOS, formats rejected by the native decoder can use an installed FFmpeg helper.
This explicit-playback fallback stages one input (100 MiB maximum) and converted MP4
in a randomized mode-0700 temporary directory. Conversion has a two-minute deadline,
a 100 MiB output acceptance limit and an OS-enforced 128 MiB per-file ceiling.
Cancellation kills/reaps the helper; normal cleanup unlinks both files before playback,
while the native decoder retains an open descriptor. Forced termination or filesystem
errors may leave temporary files. No URLs, credentials or media diagnostics reach the
helper; its file-only demuxing is restricted to MOV/MP4 and Matroska/WebM.
FFmpeg's own demuxer/codec allocations are additional to the native-player budget;
its individual allocation requests are capped at 16 MiB and conversion uses two
codec threads plus one filter thread. The helper is an optional installed process,
not a bundled decoder or a total-process memory sandbox.


### Application components and private replies (schema 20)

Message component trees retain at most 40 nodes, eight nesting levels and 128 KiB
of estimated owned data per message. Cache JSON is separately capped at 256 KiB;
invalid stored trees reject the page. Application IDs, decimal message flags and component payloads count
toward the existing account-isolated message cache byte budgets. Component URLs
remain untrusted and do not authorize arbitrary fetches.

One interaction and one modal are active at a time. Modal inputs, Gateway session
IDs and file selections are never persisted. Private/ephemeral responses are a
session-only list of at most 16 messages / 512 KiB, each at most 256 KiB, released
on navigation, disconnect or session change. They bypass the channel timeline,
notifications and disk writes; the disk adapter rejects ephemeral records.
Native modal attachments reuse the bounded upload worker (10 files / 500 MB total),
with explicit selection and no automatic write retry. Each of at most five form
file fields stages at most 10 files / 500 MB before the combined submission bound
is enforced; paths and contents never enter diagnostics or model/UI form data.

### Slash command catalogs and inputs

One active conversation retains at most 2,000 typed application command definitions within
4 MiB minus 1 KiB of estimated owned data, reserving space for the enclosing event. The HTTP
index is capped at 4 MiB and both command/application arrays at 2,000 entries. The decoder
discards raw JSON after projection and removes spare outer-vector capacity before queueing.
Each schema is capped at 128 KiB, 1,024 option nodes, 25 options/choices per level and the
root/group/subcommand/value hierarchy. Catalogs, application labels and argument-form values
remain session-only; no SQLite schema, disk cache, recents or background index polling is added.
Optional application icon hashes use the existing 32-hexadecimal-character validation
(with an optional `a_` prefix), count toward schema bytes and never enter submissions.
Visible artwork uses fixed Discord CDN URLs through the existing credential-free image
worker and bounded image disk/texture caches; no separate icon cache or metadata fetch is added.
Each application/command permission layer holds at most 100 combined current-user, role
and channel overrides. IDs and values are validated, duplicate map keys are rejected, and
conservative map allocation estimates count toward the schema/catalog budgets. Default
permission bits and overrides remain session-only and are excluded from submissions. The
picker retains at most 2,000 fixed-size available-application IDs alongside its bounded rows;
permission filtering uses the received index and existing role state without extra REST calls.

Catalog reads run in one replaceable worker using the existing REST admission and bounded
event queue. Channel, account generation and request ID reject stale results. Navigation,
disconnect, account reset and relevant permission invalidation release the retained catalog.
An oversized catalog is a local picker error, not a reason to discard the authenticated session.
The picker filters a bounded catalog locally and retains at most 64 matching rows. One argument
form holds at most 25 values, with strings limited to 6,000 Unicode characters / 24,000 UTF-8
bytes each. One last submitted form is also retained for explicit editing after a failure;
it never overwrites an occupied draft and is released on channel/account changes. The complete
encoded interaction, including command schema, arguments and session
metadata, must fit 256 KiB before submission; the existing single-interaction and no-replay
rules apply. Inputs and private replies are not logged. Ordinary composer text and messages
produced by built-in commands retain their existing draft/message storage policy.

### Forum card summaries

Visible active forum posts request up to four recent history pages concurrently,
matching the existing REST permit bound. Each uses at most 512 KiB of HTTP input and
50 records. The worker retains only sorted message
IDs and the latest author's name, bounded role IDs, webhook marker and plain excerpt;
spoilers stay concealed. The session keeps at most 200 summaries of 4 KiB each, plus
bounded map metadata, in RAM and reuses them across forum switches. Refresh,
disconnect and account reset release them; permission loss prunes inaccessible entries.
No new disk cache is introduced. Startup read cursors
for not-yet-loaded threads remain in the existing item/byte-bounded read-state map.

### Stickers (schema 21)

Cached messages retain at most three bounded sticker records in `sticker_items`
JSON, with a 32 KiB row limit and the existing account-isolated timeline/disk
budgets. Schema 20 migrates transactionally with empty legacy rows; older clients
cannot open schema 21. Modern absent/null patches and legacy sticker fallback
preserve their distinction.

Each guild catalog admits at most 500 records / 512 KiB within the existing
account navigation budget. Catalog provenance binds each sticker to its parent
guild. Standard packs are session-only, at most 128 packs / 1 MiB; their HTTP body
is capped at 1 MiB. One 16 KiB metadata response and at most 24 recent stickers /
64 KiB are retained. Names, descriptions and tags are capped at 120, 4096 and 1024
UTF-8 bytes respectively. Recents are updated only by confirmed sends, released
on logout, and are not persisted or synchronized.

Images reuse the account-isolated credential-free cache, fixed Discord CDN hosts,
existing download/decoder queues, four-animation / 16 MiB UI budget and the
80-frame / 8 MiB / 160px animation decoder limit. Lottie input is capped at
512 KiB and a 1024px source canvas; one 160px static PNG is rendered off-thread
and cached instead of the JSON. No external image origin, log or background
catalog polling is introduced.

### Search rich-text previews

Search rich-text previews retain at most 25 messages / 256 KiB per page, with
8 KiB of source per message; oversized messages show an explicit preview-limit notice.
Formatting reuses the 512-entry / 1 MiB bounded parser cache, pruned to the current
page and cleared when search closes. Spoilers remain concealed until revealed;
custom emoji reuse the existing visible-only image requests. No search persistence
or background pagination is added.

### Emoji and sticker image sharing

The opt-in plugin stages public artwork as ordinary attachments only after selection.
One host download/preparation uses generated HTTPS CDN URLs without credentials or
redirects, capped at 8 MiB per image and 15 seconds per request. Raster preview decoding
uses the existing 64 MiB allocation limit and 320px thumbnail edge outside rendering.
Up to ten selected images remain in session RAM (80 MiB encoded artwork maximum),
with no temporary files or recovery cache. Navigation/logout cancel pending preparation;
The picker selection authorizes one send after validation; ordinary upload permissions
and cleanup apply. Existing selected files are never included in that send.


### Local camera settings preview

The explicit settings preview shares the process-wide single camera-worker limit with
calls. It retains one 640×480 RGBA picture (1,228,800 bytes), one UI texture and its
upload copy, alongside the existing bounded native capture/encoding buffers. It has
no network sender, recording or persistent storage. Device choices stay session-local;
discovery retains at most 32 IDs/names (136 KiB). Closing Voice & Audio, changing the
camera, joining a call or logout releases the preview; asynchronous native teardown
keeps the worker slot reserved until it finishes.

### Forward picker

One session-bound picker retains source IDs, a search query (256 characters / 1024 UTF-8 bytes),
an optional note (MAX_CONTENT characters), at most five destination IDs and ten send nonces.
The source preview is limited to 240 characters and conceals spoiler-containing text. No source
message or attachment is copied into a new cache. Forward and optional-note writes share the
64-item / MAX_DRAFT_BYTES pending-send budget and existing serial write queue. Closing the picker
releases its input; account generation and source navigation changes invalidate it. No new disk
schema or persistence is introduced.

Member-list recovery (September 22): the lazy Gateway mirror retains at most 200 slots /
256 KiB of row metadata, plus at most 514 group IDs of up to 32 bytes each. Applying a
member-list packet stages one bounded copy so malformed operations cannot erase the last
valid list; that copy is released before the next packet. The existing 1 MiB core member
chunk cache is unchanged. Cached guild presence survives loading/reconnect while access
remains available; session reset, permission loss and explicit offline/clear retain their
existing invalidation behavior. No new persistence, directory fetch or background worker.

Member-list resilience (September 23): the 200-slot / 256 KiB mirror budget is now enforced
by shedding rich-activity details (far rows first), then far rows, instead of rejecting the
packet. Each decoded row is captured once as raw JSON for per-row isolation and released with
the packet. A connection remembers at most 8 recently left list IDs (up to 32 bytes each, no
row data) so late replies are not mistaken for the open list. No new persistence.
