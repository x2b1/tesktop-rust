## Outputs and host actions

A handler returns a result describing what tesktop2 should display or do. Some
fields update the plugin's local state immediately; a draft change or app action
is a proposal that the user must approve. Capability consent and **Apply** are
separate steps.

This reference describes the SDK in this source revision. App capabilities need
a supporting host; older hosts reject an unsupported manifest even when its
`api_version` is `1`. The original `Invocation` and `Output` remain supported.

### Choose the Rust result type

Use `Output` for panels, draft proposals, storage and appearance. Use `AppOutput`
when returning a `HostEffect`. Its `output` field contains the original `Output`,
and its `effects` field contains the app proposal. For an `AppInvocation`, panel
values and saved storage are under `input.invocation`.

This complete handler proposes opening General settings. Declare a `panel`
action named `open-settings` and the `navigation` capability in its manifest.

```rust
use serein_extension_sdk::{AppInvocation, AppOutput, AppView, HostEffect};

fn handle(input: AppInvocation) -> AppOutput {
    if input.app_event.is_some() || input.message_event.is_some() {
        return AppOutput::default();
    }
    match input.invocation.action.as_str() {
        "open-settings" => AppOutput {
            effects: vec![HostEffect::OpenView { view: AppView::Settings }],
            ..Default::default()
        },
        _ => AppOutput::default(),
    }
}

serein_extension_sdk::export!(handle);
```

The Rust wrappers do **not** add JSON nesting. The SDK serializes that result as
one flat object:

```json
{
  "replacement": null,
  "panel": [],
  "storage": null,
  "effects": [{"type": "open_view", "view": "settings"}]
}
```

There is no `"output"` property on the wire. Likewise, input fields such as
`action` and `values` are top-level JSON properties, not an `"invocation"` object.
The complete serialized response must fit 256 KiB, including JSON escaping.
The host rejects unknown output fields and invalid field types.

### Every output field

The Rust paths below are relative to `AppOutput`. When using the original
`Output` directly, omit the `output.` prefix.

| JSON field / Rust field | Value and required capability | When it takes effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replacement` / `output.replacement` | Optional string; `composer`. The invocation must actually contain composer text. | **Apply to Draft** replaces the original, still-unchanged draft. It never sends a message. |
| `panel` / `output.panel` | Array of native `Element` values; no separate panel capability. | A foreground result displays it. Message/app event handlers must return no elements. Activation does not display returned panels. |
| `storage` / `output.storage` | Optional opaque UTF-8 string; `storage`. | A valid foreground or event result replaces the plugin's saved value before result approval. Activation can read storage but this build does not persist its returned storage. |
| `appearance` / `output.appearance` | Optional `Theme` object; `appearance`. | An accepted result updates the plugin's appearance overlay immediately, including activation and event results. No Apply button is involved. |
| `preserve_deleted_messages` / `output.preserve_deleted_messages` | Boolean, default `false`; `deleted_messages` is required for `true`. | Only an `activation` action may enable host retention of already-loaded deleted messages. |
| `image_sharing` / `output.image_sharing` | Boolean, default `false`; `image_sharing` is required for `true`. | Only an `activation` action may enable the host's emoji/sticker image attachment mode. Enabling it does not send anything. |
| `effects` / `effects` | Array containing at most one `HostEffect`; its capability is checked separately. | The native result describes the action. It runs only after its **Apply** button is clicked and current access is rechecked. |

Closing a result discards its pending app/draft proposal. It does not undo
storage or appearance updates already accepted from that invocation. A panel's
own button runs another handler; it is different from the host's Apply button.

### Missing, null and empty values

| Field | Omitted or `null` | Explicit empty value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replacement` | No draft proposal. | `""` proposes clearing the draft; Apply is still required. |
| `storage` | Leave the saved value unchanged. | `""` saves an empty string. It does not remove the value and is not valid JSON for `storage_json`. |
| `appearance` | Leave this plugin's current overlay unchanged. | `{}` removes this plugin's overrides, exposing the underlying theme and other overlays. |
| `panel` | Omitted means `[]`; `null` is invalid. | `[]` supplies no panel elements; it is not a command to close a foreground result. |
| `effects` | Omitted means `[]`; `null` is invalid. | `[]` makes no app proposal. |
| Activation booleans | Omitted means `false`; `null` is invalid. | `false` does not enable the feature in an activation result. These are not runtime toggle commands for other surfaces. |

Every returned appearance object replaces the previous object from that plugin;
it is not a patch to the plugin's old overlay. Omitted theme fields inherit from
the underlying appearance. To save choices across account loads, store them in
a normal action and restore the overlay from activation's storage input. See the
[theme API](theme-api.md) for palette and style fields.

A complete immediate appearance result with the `appearance` grant is:

```json
{"appearance":{"dark":{"colors":{"accent":"#55CBD7"}}}}
```

Draft proposals must also satisfy the client's ordinary draft rules at Apply:
at most 2,000 characters and the account's bounded draft budget. If the account,
conversation or original draft changed, rerun the composer action. A subsequent
panel-button invocation does not receive the previous composer text and cannot
return a replacement just because its manifest also requests `composer`.

### Rules for every host action

Only foreground `message`, `composer` and `panel` actions may return `effects`.
An `activation`, `message_event` or `app_event` action cannot return them. Return
at most one proposal, at most 8 KiB for the serialized `effects` array, and do not
combine a proposal with a non-null `replacement` in the same result.

The user sees the actual operation and values before applying it. Apply rechecks
that the plugin is enabled, its capability is still granted, the account and
originating conversation are unchanged, and that conversation is accessible.
Each operation also has its own checks below. A stale proposal fails instead of
following a later navigation or controlling a replacement call.

All examples below are complete JSON output objects. Other output fields are
optional. IDs such as `"20"` are illustrative: use real IDs from granted input.
Channel, message and user IDs are strings of decimal digits representing nonzero
`u64` values, at most 20 bytes, not JSON numbers or names.

### HostEffect index

Each operation requires the listed capability and the shared Apply checks above.
Follow an operation for its fields, example and additional checks.

| JSON `type` | Required capability | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `navigate` | `navigation` | [Open a known channel](extension-sdk-actions.md#open-conversations-profiles-and-search) |
| `home` | `navigation` | [Return to Friends/Home](extension-sdk-actions.md#open-conversations-profiles-and-search) |
| `open_view` | `navigation` | [Open a native view](extension-sdk-actions.md#all-18-appview-values) |
| `open_profile` | `navigation` | [Open a known user's profile](extension-sdk-actions.md#open-conversations-profiles-and-search) |
| `jump_to_message` | `navigation` | [Jump to a message](extension-sdk-actions.md#open-conversations-profiles-and-search) |
| `search` | `navigation` | [Search the current conversation](extension-sdk-actions.md#open-conversations-profiles-and-search) |
| `notice` | `local_notices` | [Show a local notice](extension-sdk-actions.md#show-a-local-notice-or-copy-text) |
| `copy_text` | `clipboard_write` | [Copy text to the clipboard](extension-sdk-actions.md#show-a-local-notice-or-copy-text) |
| `set_voice` | `voice_control` | [Set mute and deafen](extension-sdk-actions.md#control-the-current-call) |
| `leave_voice` | `voice_control` | [Leave the current call](extension-sdk-actions.md#control-the-current-call) |
| `set_local_settings` | `local_settings` | [Change reading preferences](extension-sdk-actions.md#change-local-reading-settings) |
| `set_notification_settings` | `notification_settings` | [Change device notifications](extension-sdk-actions.md#change-device-local-notification-settings) |
| `app_action` | Depends on nested action | [Messages, threads, accounts and media](extension-sdk-actions.md#app-actions) |
| `tracked_app_action` | Nested action grant plus `action_feedback` | [Receive Apply admission results](extension-sdk-actions.md#tracked-actions) |

### App actions

`HostEffect::AppAction { action: AppAction }` proposes a typed operation through
tesktop2's existing app controls. The outer `type` is `app_action`; the nested
`action.type` selects the operation. Each operation has a separate write grant.
Read-only grants never authorize writes. Most action grants do not disclose data;
`account_control` also exposes own presence/activity preferences, and
`audio_settings` also exposes current audio preferences. Other snapshot groups
still require their respective read grants.
All operations retain the one-proposal, foreground-only, 8 KiB limit and **Apply**.

#### Queries and native editors

These actions expose existing native paths. Query actions require `data_queries`;
their latest bounded result appears in `ExtendedAppInvocation.queries` on the
app-event handler. Settings and folders use their same-named capability.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Grant and effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_message_search` / `RequestMessageSearch` | `query`; optional `before_id` | `data_queries`; search the selected readable conversation. |
| `request_pins` / `RequestPins` | optional `before` cursor | `data_queries`; load the selected conversation's pins. |
| `request_archives` / `RequestArchives` | `parent_id`, `kind`; optional `before` | `data_queries`; load public, private or joined-private archived threads. |
| `request_member_search` / `RequestMemberSearch` | `channel_id`, `query` | `data_queries`; search members in the selected server channel. |
| `request_profile` / `RequestProfile` | `user_id`; optional `guild_id` | `data_queries`; load a bounded profile for the current user, a friend or a user known in the selected conversation. |
| `request_gifs` / `RequestGifs` | optional `query` | `data_queries`; load GIF categories or search results. |
| `set_messaging_settings` / `SetMessagingSettings` | typed `change` | `messaging_settings`; update one loaded account privacy preference. |
| `set_guild_folders` / `SetGuildFolders` | `base_version`; complete `folders` array | `guild_folders`; replace the loaded folder layout only if `base_version` still matches the snapshot. |
| `open_join_server` / `OpenJoinServer` | `invite` | `server_control`; open the native invite review/CAPTCHA flow. |
| `send_server_invite` / `SendServerInvite` | `guild_id`, `user_id` | `server_control`; send a server invite to a loaded friend. |
| `open_server_admin` / `OpenServerAdmin` | `guild_id`, `page` | `server_control`; open `emoji`, `members`, `roles`, `invites` or `audit_log`. |
| `open_group_editor` / `OpenGroupEditor` | `channel_id` | `channel_control`; open the native group-DM editor. |

Query cursors are opaque strings. Reuse only the cursor from the current matching
snapshot; stale or cross-query cursors are rejected. Integrations, webhooks and
slash commands are deliberately absent.

#### Tracked actions

`HostEffect::TrackedAppAction` has `request_id` plus the same nested `action` as
`app_action`. It additionally requires `action_feedback`, `app_events` and one
`app_event` action. Decode that handler as `ExtendedAppInvocation` and inspect
`action_result`:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"tracked_app_action","request_id":"save-42","action":{"type":"set_activity_sharing","enabled":false}}]}
```

The result status is `accepted` or `rejected`; its code is `accepted`,
`context_changed`, `unavailable`, `invalid`, `denied` or `failed`. This reports
whether Apply entered the native path. A queued network operation can still fail
later through the app's ordinary status UI.

For example, a handler with `message_send` can propose:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"send_message","channel_id":"20","content":"Hello from my tool"}}]}
```

tesktop2 displays the destination and exact text. Nothing is sent until Apply.
Apply rechecks the account, selected channel, access and normal sending limits.
This sends the proposed text only: the user's existing draft, reply and selected
attachments remain intact. It does not attach files or automatically mention a
reply target. Normal service failures remain visible in tesktop2's pending-message UI.

#### Messages and read markers

All IDs below are nonzero decimal strings. Operations targeting an existing
message require it to be loaded and accessible in the selected channel, plus
the ordinary operation's permissions. Sending requires an eligible selected
channel, not an existing message. Content must be nonblank, at most 2,000 characters and 8,000 UTF-8
bytes, and still fit the complete 8 KiB escaped effect. Use existing snapshots
to find IDs; these actions do not offer arbitrary message lookup.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Grant and effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send_message` / `SendMessage` | `channel_id`, `content`: strings | `message_send`; send explicit text in the selected conversation. |
| `send_reply` / `SendReply` | `channel_id`, `message_id`, `content`: strings; `mention`: boolean | `message_send`; reply to a loaded message. `mention` controls whether the reply mentions its author. **Preview.** |
| `send_sticker` / `SendSticker` | `channel_id`, `sticker_id`: IDs | `message_send`; send one sticker from the host's loaded sticker catalog. **Preview.** |
| `forward_message` / `ForwardMessage` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs; `target_channel_ids`: array of 1–5 distinct IDs; `note`: string | `message_send`; forward a loaded source message to the selected accessible destinations, optionally with a note. **Preview.** |
| `open_attachment_picker` / `OpenAttachmentPicker` | `channel_id`: ID | `message_send`; open tesktop2's native attachment picker for the still-selected text conversation. The plugin receives no path or bytes and nothing is sent automatically. **Preview.** |
| `edit_message` / `EditMessage` | `channel_id`, `message_id`, `content`: strings | `message_manage`; edit a loaded message authored by the current user. |
| `delete_message` / `DeleteMessage` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs | `message_manage`; delete an eligible loaded message. Requires ownership or native moderation permission. **Deletion cannot be undone.** |
| `set_message_pinned` / `SetMessagePinned` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs; `pinned`: boolean | `message_manage`; set the desired pin state using native permissions. |
| `set_reaction` / `SetReaction` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs; `emoji`: string; `add`: boolean | `reactions_control`; ensure your reaction is present or absent. Already matching state does nothing; this never blindly toggles. |
| `mark_read` / `MarkRead` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs | `read_state_control`; acknowledge a loaded boundary in the selected conversation. |
| `mark_channel_read` / `MarkChannelRead` | `channel_id`: ID | `read_state_control`; acknowledge a known accessible channel using its current latest-message metadata. |
| `mark_unread` / `MarkUnread` | `channel_id`, `message_id`: IDs | `read_state_control`; mark the loaded message boundary unread through the native marker path. |
| `mark_guild_read` / `MarkGuildRead` | `guild_id`: ID | `read_state_control`; mark an eligible known server read. |
| `jump_to_unread` / `JumpToUnread` | None | `navigation`; jump to the selected conversation's unread boundary. May load ordinary history. |

`emoji` is a Unicode emoji or the custom-emoji wire form `name:id`. Custom IDs
must be nonzero. Custom names use 2-32 ASCII letters, digits or underscores;
the whole emoji string is at most 128 UTF-8 bytes with no controls. The host's
ordinary reaction validation also applies. Unknown or
pending reaction state may be unavailable; rerun after it loads.

Reply and forward source messages must already be loaded in `channel_id`.
`SendSticker` accepts only a sticker the native client has loaded for the current
context; it does not turn an arbitrary asset ID into a fetch. Reply and forward
notes use the same 2,000-character / 8,000-byte text bound as `SendMessage`.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"send_reply","channel_id":"20","message_id":"200","content":"Thanks — fixed.","mention":true}}]}
```

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_reaction","channel_id":"20","message_id":"200","emoji":"👍","add":true}}]}
```

#### Threads and forum posts

These actions require `threads_control`. Names and titles are nonblank strings
of at most 100 characters and 400 UTF-8 bytes, without control characters.
Forum content follows the message-text limits above. Creating a thread/post is
a Discord write, not a local preview. Normal channel access, ownership, thread
permissions, loaded details and pending-operation checks apply again at Apply.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_thread` / `CreateThread` | `channel_id`, `name`; optional `message_id` | Create a thread, optionally from an eligible loaded starter message. Omit/null `message_id` for no starter. |
| `create_forum_post` / `CreateForumPost` | `parent_id`, `title`, `content` | Create a text-only forum/media post in an eligible parent. |
| `set_thread_archived` / `SetThreadArchived` | `channel_id`; `archived`: boolean | Set archived state. |
| `set_thread_locked` / `SetThreadLocked` | `channel_id`; `locked`: boolean | Set locked state. |
| `set_thread_followed` / `SetThreadFollowed` | `channel_id`; `followed`: boolean | Join/follow or leave/unfollow a thread. |
| `set_thread_pinned` / `SetThreadPinned` | `channel_id`; `pinned`: boolean | Set a forum post's pin state. |
| `rename_thread` / `RenameThread` | `channel_id`, `name` | Rename an eligible loaded thread/post. |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"create_thread","channel_id":"20","name":"Release discussion","message_id":"200"}}]}
```

The [Conversation Actions example](../examples/extensions/app-actions/src/lib.rs)
provides a complete native form, handler and manifest for these operations.
It checks that its form's conversation still matches the current snapshot;
tesktop2 independently validates the resulting proposal.

#### Channels, conversations and servers

> **Preview SDK — PR #411, not yet released.**

These operations reuse tesktop2's native channel, group, DM and server admission
paths. `channel_control` covers channel administration and conversation-local
settings. `server_control` is separate because invites and leaving a server have
different scope and consequences. Apply rechecks the loaded target, access,
native permissions and pending operations.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Grant and effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set_channel_mute` / `SetChannelMute` | `channel_id`: ID; `duration_seconds`: `null` or integer | `channel_control`; `null` unmutes, `0` mutes until changed, or use 900, 3600, 10800, 28800 or 86400 seconds. |
| `set_channel_notifications` / `SetChannelNotifications` | `channel_id`: ID; `level`: integer 0–3 | `channel_control`; set the native notification level for a channel or post. |
| `set_guild_hide_muted` / `SetGuildHideMuted` | `guild_id`: ID; `hide`: boolean | `channel_control`; show or hide muted channels in a loaded server. |
| `create_channel` / `CreateChannel` | `guild_id`: ID; `name`: string; `kind`: `"text"`, `"voice"` or `"forum"` | `channel_control`; create a server channel through a currently manageable server channel. |
| `create_category` / `CreateCategory` | `guild_id`: ID; `name`: string | `channel_control`; create a category. |
| `duplicate_channel` / `DuplicateChannel` | `channel_id`: ID; `name`: string | `channel_control`; duplicate a manageable channel with the supplied name. |
| `edit_channel` / `EditChannel` | `channel_id`: ID; `before`, `after`: `ChannelEditInput` | `channel_control`; apply an exact validated edit while preserving the native before/after conflict check. |
| `delete_channel` / `DeleteChannel` | `channel_id`: ID | `channel_control`; delete a manageable channel. **This cannot be undone.** |
| `move_channel` / `MoveChannel` | `channel_id`: ID; `parent_id`: ID or `null`; `position`: nonnegative integer; `lock_permissions`: boolean; `shifts`: up to 100 `ChannelPositionInput` rows | `channel_control`; move/reorder a channel using the native hierarchy action. |
| `leave_group` / `LeaveGroup` | `channel_id`: ID | `channel_control`; leave a loaded group DM. |
| `rename_group` / `RenameGroup` | `channel_id`: ID; `name`: string | `channel_control`; rename a loaded group DM. |
| `close_dm` / `CloseDm` | `channel_id`: ID | `channel_control`; close a loaded one-to-one DM from the list. It does not delete message history. |
| `set_conversation_muted` / `SetConversationMuted` | `channel_id`: ID; `muted`: boolean | `channel_control`; set the loaded DM/group mute state. |
| `create_server_invite` / `CreateServerInvite` | `guild_id`: ID; `channel_id`: ID or `null`; `max_age`: 0–2592000; `max_uses`: 0–100; `temporary`: boolean | `server_control`; create an invite. A null channel lets the host choose its eligible native invite channel; zero duration/uses mean no limit. |
| `leave_server` / `LeaveServer` | `guild_id`: ID | `server_control`; leave a loaded server. **This can remove access immediately.** |
| `update_server_settings` / `UpdateServerSettings` | `guild_id`: ID; `settings`: `ServerSettingsPatch` | `server_control`; update already-loaded server settings through the native stale-state and permission checks. |
| `rename_server_emoji` / `RenameServerEmoji` | `guild_id`, `emoji_id`: IDs; `name`: string | `server_control`; rename a server emoji to 2–32 ASCII letters, digits or underscores. |
| `delete_server_emoji` / `DeleteServerEmoji` | `guild_id`, `emoji_id`: IDs | `server_control`; delete a server emoji. **This cannot be undone.** |

`ChannelEditInput` is a complete object with `name: String`, `topic: String`,
`slowmode: u32`, `nsfw: bool`, and `overwrites: Vec<PermissionOverwriteInput>`.
Names are nonblank and limited to 100 characters / 400 bytes. Topics may be
empty and are limited to 4,096 characters; slow mode is at most 21,600 seconds.
Each permission overwrite has `id: String`, `kind: u8` (`0` role, `1` member),
and decimal-string `allow` and `deny` masks that fit `u128`. At most 100 distinct
`(id, kind)` rows are accepted. Supply the values the plugin observed as
`before`; the host rejects a stale edit instead of overwriting a newer change.

`ChannelPositionInput` has `channel_id: String` and a nonnegative `position: i32`.
The `shifts` array is the bounded native reorder plan; IDs must be distinct.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"create_channel","guild_id":"10","name":"release-notes","kind":"text"}}]}
```

`ServerSettingsPatch` rejects an empty patch. Omitted/null optional fields
preserve their values. The host requires the matching server-settings model to
remain loaded at Apply.

| Patch field | Rust / JSON type | Meaning and bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Server name; nonblank, at most 100 characters. |
| `banner_color` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | 24-bit banner color, 0–16777215. |
| `traits` | `Option<Vec<ServerTraitInput>>` / array or null | Replace traits with at most five rows. Each row has nonblank `label: String` (100 characters) and `emoji: Option<String>` (32 characters). An empty array clears the traits. |
| `description` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Description, at most 300 characters; an empty string clears it. |
| `system_channel_id` | `Option<String>` / ID or null | Set the system channel. Cannot accompany `clear_system_channel: true`. |
| `clear_system_channel` | `bool` / boolean | Defaults to false; true clears the system channel. |
| `system_channel_flags` | `Option<u64>` / integer or null | Replace the native system-channel flag bits. |
| `activity_feed` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Enable or disable the server activity feed. |
| `default_message_notifications` | `Option<u8>` / 0, 1 or null | Set the native default notification level. |
| `afk_channel_id` | `Option<String>` / ID or null | Set the AFK voice channel. Cannot accompany `clear_afk_channel: true`. |
| `clear_afk_channel` | `bool` / boolean | Defaults to false; true clears the AFK channel. |
| `afk_timeout` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | AFK timeout: 60, 300, 900, 1800 or 3600 seconds. |

Image/icon uploads are intentionally absent because Wasm receives no file paths
or bytes.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"update_server_settings","guild_id":"10","settings":{"name":"tesktop2 Community","description":"Native client discussion","activity_feed":false}}}]}
```

#### Roles and moderation

> **Preview SDK — PR #411, not yet released.**

Role changes require `role_control`; member changes require
`moderation_control`. All operations run through the native server-admin queue,
so the guild, target, hierarchy, permissions, loaded state and pending-operation
guards still apply.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Grant and effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_role` / `CreateRole` | `guild_id`: ID; `role`: `RolePatch` | `role_control`; create a role with the supplied bounded fields. |
| `edit_role` / `EditRole` | `guild_id`, `role_id`: IDs; `role`: `RolePatch` | `role_control`; patch a manageable loaded role. |
| `delete_role` / `DeleteRole` | `guild_id`, `role_id`: IDs | `role_control`; delete a manageable role. **This cannot be undone.** |
| `move_role` / `MoveRole` | `guild_id`, `role_id`: IDs; `position`: integer 1–4096 | `role_control`; move a manageable role within the native hierarchy. |
| `set_member_role` / `SetMemberRole` | `guild_id`, `user_id`, `role_id`: IDs; `assigned`: boolean | `moderation_control`; assign or remove a manageable role. |
| `set_member_nickname` / `SetMemberNickname` | `guild_id`, `user_id`: IDs; `nickname`: string | `moderation_control`; set a member nickname; empty clears it, otherwise at most 32 characters. |
| `kick_member` / `KickMember` | `guild_id`, `user_id`: IDs | `moderation_control`; remove a member from the server. **This is destructive.** |
| `prune_members` / `PruneMembers` | `guild_id`: ID; `days`: 1, 7 or 30; `execute`: boolean | `moderation_control`; `false` requests the native preview/count, `true` executes the prune. **Execution can remove many members.** |
| `set_member_list_visible` / `SetMemberListVisible` | `guild_id`: ID; `enabled`: boolean | `moderation_control`; show/load or hide the server's native member list through its existing bounded path. |

`RolePatch` rejects an empty patch. Omitted/null optional fields preserve the
existing value.

| Patch field | Rust / JSON type | Meaning and bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Nonblank role name, at most 100 characters. |
| `primary_color` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | Primary 24-bit role color. Supplying it enables the color patch. |
| `secondary_color`, `tertiary_color` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | Optional 24-bit companion colors. Either requires `primary_color` in the same patch. |
| `permissions` | `Option<String>` / decimal string or null | Permission bits fitting `u128`. |
| `permission_mask` | `Option<String>` / decimal string or null | Bits to replace. It requires `permissions` in the same patch; an omitted mask with permissions applies the full `u128` mask. |
| `hoist` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Set separate role display. |
| `mentionable` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Set whether the role can be mentioned. |
| `unicode_emoji` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Role emoji, at most 32 characters. Cannot accompany `clear_unicode_emoji: true`. |
| `clear_unicode_emoji` | `bool` / boolean | Defaults to false; true clears the role emoji. |

{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"create_role","guild_id":"10","role":{"name":"Helpers","primary_color":1193046,"permissions":"8","mentionable":true}}}]}
```

#### Friends, notes and blocks

These seven operations require `relationship_control`. IDs are `String` /
nonzero decimal strings. They reuse native pending-operation and account checks;
missing loaded data is an error, not permission to fetch or guess a target.

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Apply behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open_friend_dm` / `OpenFriendDm` | `user_id`: ID | Open a loaded friend's direct conversation, creating/loading it through the ordinary native path if needed. Unfinished server-settings edits can block navigation. |
| `set_friend_nickname` / `SetFriendNickname` | `user_id`: ID; `text`: `String` | Set a loaded friend's nickname. At most 32 characters / 128 UTF-8 bytes; no controls. Empty clears it. |
| `set_user_note` / `SetUserNote` | `user_id`: ID; `text`: `String` | Replace an already-loaded user note. At most 256 characters / 1,024 UTF-8 bytes; newline and tab are allowed. Empty clears it. This action does not load a missing note. |
| `add_friend` / `AddFriend` | `username`: `String` | Send a friend request. Use 2-32 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, underscores or periods, with no consecutive periods. No leading `@`. Existing/pending requests can make it unavailable. |
| `remove_friend` / `RemoveFriend` | `user_id`: ID | Remove an eligible loaded friend; native relationship/request/block readiness still applies. |
| `resolve_friend_request` / `ResolveFriendRequest` | `user_id`: ID; `accept`: `bool` | Accept an incoming request, or decline/cancel an eligible existing request with `false`. |
| `set_user_blocked` / `SetUserBlocked` | `user_id`: ID; `blocked`: `bool` | Set block state for a user known through loaded friends, restrictions, requests or the readable selected conversation. |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_friend_nickname","user_id":"40","text":"Project partner"}}]}
```

These account writes are not plugin storage. Service errors and any required
user-solved verification use tesktop2's ordinary native flow. A plugin receives no
credentials or verification bypass.

#### Own profile and presence

`set_own_profile`, `set_own_presence` and `set_activity_sharing` require
`account_control`. Profile/presence patches require at least one meaningful field;
empty or all-null patches are rejected. Optional fields omitted or set to `null`
mean unchanged. Clear flags are `bool`, default to `false` when omitted, and do
not accept `null`. Invalid patches are rejected before changes are applied.

`set_own_profile` / `SetOwnProfile` has one required `profile: OwnProfilePatch`
object. The own profile must already be loaded and ready to save; the action does
not fetch missing profile data or modify an avatar.

| Patch field | Rust / JSON type | Meaning and bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `global_name` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Nonblank display name, at most 32 characters / 128 UTF-8 bytes, no controls. |
| `clear_global_name` | `bool` / boolean | Explicitly clear the display name. Cannot accompany a `global_name` value. |
| `bio` | `Option<String>` / string or null | Biography, at most 190 characters / 760 UTF-8 bytes. Newline, carriage return and tab allowed; empty clears it. |
| `pronouns` | `Option<String>` / string or null | At most 40 characters / 160 UTF-8 bytes, no controls; empty clears it. |
| `accent_color` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | RGB integer from 0 through 16,777,215 (`0xffffff`). |
| `clear_accent_color` | `bool` / boolean | Clear the custom accent. Cannot accompany an `accent_color` value. |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_own_profile","profile":{"bio":"Building something small.","clear_accent_color":true}}}]}
```

`set_own_presence` / `SetOwnPresence` has one required
`presence: OwnPresencePatch` object. Apply starts from current account presence
preferences and uses the ordinary native update/persistence path.

| Patch field | Rust / JSON type | Meaning and bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `Option<String>` / string or null | `online`, `idle`, `dnd` or `invisible`. |
| `custom_status` | `Option<String>` / string or null | At most 128 characters / 512 UTF-8 bytes, no controls or surrounding whitespace. Empty clears the text and its expiry. |
| `clear_after_seconds` | `Option<u32>` / integer or null | 0 through 86,400. Zero removes expiry; positive values start from Apply time. Omitted/null preserves existing expiry unless text is cleared. |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_own_presence","presence":{"status":"dnd","custom_status":"Focusing","clear_after_seconds":3600}}}]}
```

`set_activity_sharing` / `SetActivitySharing` requires `enabled: bool`. It changes
the native game-activity sharing preference; it does not submit an arbitrary
activity payload. An accepted preference change is not proof that another
Discord client displays public Rich Presence.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_activity_sharing","enabled":false}}]}
```

#### Audio settings and local playback

These operations require `audio_settings`. `set_audio_settings` /
`SetAudioSettings` has a required `settings: AudioSettingsPatch` object. Optional
fields omitted/null preserve current values at Apply time. The patch must contain
at least one value or `open_microphone: true`; `{}` and all-null/default patches
are invalid. `open_microphone` is a boolean defaulting to false, not an optional
field, so JSON `null` is invalid.

| Patch field | Rust / JSON type | Meaning and bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input_percent` | `Option<u16>` / integer or null | Microphone gain, 0-200 percent. |
| `output_percent` | `Option<u16>` / integer or null | Output gain, 0-200 percent. |
| `push_to_talk` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Set the native push-to-talk preference. |
| `input_profile` | `Option<String>` / string or null | `voice_isolation`, `studio` or `custom`. |
| `suppression` | `Option<String>` / string or null | `off`, `rnnoise` or `webrtc`. |
| `suppression_level` | `Option<u8>` / integer or null | Suppression level, 0-3. |
| `echo_cancellation` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Enable/disable echo cancellation. |
| `automatic_gain` | `Option<bool>` / boolean or null | Enable/disable automatic gain. |
| `sensitivity_db` | `Option<i16>` / integer or null | Microphone gate threshold, -80 through 0 dB. |
| `open_microphone` | `bool` / boolean | `true` clears the gate threshold. Cannot accompany a `sensitivity_db` value. This does not join a call, unmute it or start a microphone preview. |

Changing a processing field switches to `custom`, starting from the visible
values of the selected preset. If a patch supplies both `input_profile` and a
processing field, the selected profile supplies those starting values and the
result becomes custom. Gain/push-to-talk-only changes do not change the profile.
Settings use native runtime/persistence handling; hardware support and the
existing call's mute controls still apply.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_audio_settings","settings":{"output_percent":80,"input_profile":"studio","sensitivity_db":-50}}}]}
```

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Apply behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set_participant_audio` / `SetParticipantAudio` | `user_id`: ID; `volume_percent: Option<u16>`; `muted: Option<bool>` | Change local playback of a remote participant still in the current call. Volume is 0-200; mute preserves its configured gain for later unmute. Cannot target yourself. |
| `set_stream_audio` / `SetStreamAudio` | `volume_percent: Option<u16>`; `muted: Option<bool>` | Change local playback of the currently watched stream. Volume is 0-200. Unavailable without a watched stream. |
| `select_audio_devices` / `SelectAudioDevices` | `input_id`, `output_id`: string or null | Select at least one currently enumerated microphone/speaker by its exact host ID. Missing/null preserves that side. **Preview.** |
| `refresh_media_devices` / `RefreshMediaDevices` | None | Ask the host to refresh its microphone, speaker and camera lists. It does not return those private lists to Wasm. **Preview.** |

For participant and stream audio, optional values use JSON integer/boolean/null,
and at least one must be supplied. Omitted/null fields preserve current values.
They do not server-mute another person. The host rejects a changed/replaced call and a new
participant mute when the 64-person local mute bound is full. A stream-volume
proposal also fails if the watched stream changed before Apply.

`select_audio_devices` also needs at least one non-null ID. Each ID is a string
of at most 256 bytes without controls and must still be present in the matching
host list at Apply. It changes host preferences; neither IDs nor device lists are
returned by this action.

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"set_participant_audio","user_id":"40","volume_percent":75,"muted":false}}]}
```

#### Calls, streams and camera

| Nested `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Required grant and Apply behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `join_voice` / `JoinVoice` | `channel_id`: ID; `ring`, `muted`, `deafened`: `bool` | `voice_connect`; request joining/calling a native eligible channel with explicit ring and audio choices. Joining with an unmuted microphone can transmit audio. |
| `decline_call` / `DeclineCall` | `channel_id`: ID | `voice_connect`; decline the currently incoming call only if it still targets this channel. |
| `watch_stream` / `WatchStream` | `user_id`: ID | `voice_control`; watch an available remote participant stream in the current call. |
| `stop_watching` / `StopWatching` | None | `voice_control`; stop watching the current stream. Unavailable when none is watched. |
| `set_camera` / `SetCamera` | `enabled`: `bool` | `camera_control`; enable/disable camera transmission in the current call. Enabling requires available camera capture and shares video with participants. Already matching state does nothing. |
| `select_camera_device` / `SelectCameraDevice` | `device_id`: string or null | `camera_control`; select a currently enumerated camera, or null to clear the selection. Device IDs are at most 256 bytes and remain host-local. **Preview.** |
| `open_screen_share_picker` / `OpenScreenSharePicker` | None | `media_control`; open the native screen/window picker for the current call. The plugin receives no source list or frames. **Preview.** |
| `stop_screen_share` / `StopScreenShare` | None | `media_control`; stop the current native screen share. **Preview.** |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"app_action","action":{"type":"join_voice","channel_id":"20","ring":false,"muted":true,"deafened":false}}]}
```

Apply rechecks native call availability and the captured call identity. Switching
away from an existing call still requires the native switch confirmation; the
plugin cannot bypass it. Participant playback, stream watching and camera
proposals are rejected if the original call has ended or been replaced. Stop-watching
proposals also require the originally watched stream. Normal
permission/device checks may reject otherwise well-formed proposals. These
operations do not expose raw media to Wasm. Preview media actions only open or
control native host UI; they do not disclose device names, identifiers, source
lists, file paths, attachment bytes or captured frames to the plugin.

### Open conversations, profiles and search

These six action types require `navigation`. Read capabilities remain separate:
request `channel_directory`, `app_context` or another read grant only when your
handler needs the corresponding input data.

| JSON `type` / Rust variant | Required fields | What Apply does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `navigate` / `Navigate` | `channel_id`: string ID. | Opens a channel already known and readable in this session, using normal navigation. |
| `home` / `Home` | None. | Opens Friends/Home and clears the current conversation selection. |
| `open_view` / `OpenView` | `view`: one `AppView` string from the table below. | Opens the named native view. |
| `open_profile` / `OpenProfile` | `user_id`: string ID. | Opens your profile, a known friend's profile, or a user known in the readable current conversation. Arbitrary unknown users are rejected. |
| `jump_to_message` / `JumpToMessage` | `channel_id` and `message_id`: string IDs. | Uses normal message navigation in a known readable text channel. Requires a connected session; a known-deleted target is unavailable. |
| `search` / `Search` | `query`: nonblank search string, at most 256 UTF-8 bytes, without control characters. | Runs the normal search in the current readable conversation when connected. Normal search syntax validation also applies. |

Open a known channel:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"navigate","channel_id":"20"}]}
```

Return Home:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"home"}]}
```

Open Appearance settings:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"open_view","view":"appearance"}]}
```

Open a known user's profile:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"open_profile","user_id":"300"}]}
```

Jump to a message:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"jump_to_message","channel_id":"20","message_id":"200"}]}
```

Search the active conversation:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"search","query":"release notes"}]}
```

Navigation, profile and search views may load ordinary service data after Apply.
They do not give Wasm a network API or a search-results callback. Channel/Home
navigation also respects the native guard for unfinished server-settings edits.

### All 18 AppView values

Every row uses `open_view` and requires `navigation` plus a valid proposal context.
The thirteen settings destinations simply open a page; they do not change its
settings. Other views have the extra conditions described here.

| JSON value / Rust variant | Native destination | Use conditions or effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `friends` / `Friends` | Friends / Home | Same behavior as `home`. |
| `search` / `Search` | Conversation search | A readable active text conversation and connected session; opens the search controls, preserving an existing query for that conversation. |
| `pins` / `Pins` | Pinned messages | A readable active text conversation and connected session; requests its pins. |
| `members` / `Members` | People / member list | A readable active text conversation; opens the list, enables its wide-window visibility preference and uses normal member loading when available. |
| `threads` / `Threads` | Threads / archived posts | An accessible selected guild text, announcement, forum or media parent channel; requires connection and history access. It cannot browse an arbitrary unselected parent. |
| `settings` / `Settings` | General | Opens General settings. |
| `account` / `Account` | My Account | Opens the current account's page. |
| `profile_settings` / `ProfileSettings` | Profile | Opens your profile editor; does not submit edits. |
| `appearance` / `Appearance` | Appearance | Opens appearance and reading controls. |
| `messaging_permissions` / `MessagingPermissions` | Messaging Permissions | Opens messaging privacy controls. |
| `notifications` / `Notifications` | Notifications | Opens notification preferences. |
| `activity` / `Activity` | Game Activity | Opens activity settings. |
| `voice_settings` / `VoiceSettings` | Voice & Video | Opens device and voice settings; does not join a call or start media. |
| `keybinds` / `Keybinds` | Keybinds | Opens keyboard shortcuts. |
| `storage` / `Storage` | Data & Privacy | Opens local storage controls; does not clear data. |
| `updates` / `Updates` | Updates | Opens update settings; does not install an update. |
| `extensions` / `Extensions` | Extensions | Opens the plugin shop and installed plugins. |
| `themes` / `Themes` | Themes | Opens the theme shop and installed themes. |

`profile_settings` edits your own profile. `open_profile` instead opens a known
user's profile card. The view named `storage` opens app settings; it is unrelated
to the plugin `storage` output field.

### Show a local notice or copy text

| JSON `type` / Rust variant | Required fields | Capability and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notice` / `Notice` | `text`: nonblank string, at most 1,024 UTF-8 bytes. | `local_notices`; shows an in-app toast prefixed by the plugin name after Apply. It is not an operating-system notification. |
| `copy_text` / `CopyText` | `text`: string, at most 4,096 UTF-8 bytes; empty is allowed. | `clipboard_write`; replaces clipboard text after Apply. It never reads the clipboard. |

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"notice","text":"Your local review is ready."}]}
```

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"copy_text","text":"Synthetic meeting notes\nReview the release checklist."}]}
```

These are alternatives: two effects in one output are invalid. Ask the user to
run a separate action for each operation.

### Control the current call

Both action types require `voice_control`. The optional `voice_state` read grant
lets a handler inspect the call first, but does not authorize changing it.

| JSON `type` / Rust variant | Required fields | What Apply does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set_voice` / `SetVoice` | `muted`: boolean; `deafened`: boolean. Both must be supplied. | Sets the current call's local mute and deafen choices through the ordinary call controls. |
| `leave_voice` / `LeaveVoice` | None. | Leaves the same call that was active when this invocation was created. |

Mute without deafening:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"set_voice","muted":true,"deafened":false}]}
```

Leave that call:

```json
{"effects":[{"type":"leave_voice"}]}
```

`muted: true` stops microphone transmission. `deafened: true` deafens the call and
also mutes transmission, even if `muted` is `false`. `muted` remains the separate
self-mute choice: to undeafen while staying muted, send `true, false`; to request
both off, send `false, false`. These are explicit values, not toggles. Normal
call availability and speaking permissions still apply; the host can retain a
required mute and rejects an unavailable unmute.

The host records both the call channel and its local request identity **before**
running the plugin. If the call ends, switches channels, or is replaced by a new
call on the same channel, Apply rejects the old proposal. The plugin cannot
choose or forge that identity. There must already be a call: neither action can
join a channel, start a call, enable a camera, share a screen or record media.

### Change local reading settings

`set_local_settings` / `HostEffect::SetLocalSettings` requires `local_settings`.
Its required `settings` object is a `LocalSettingsPatch`: include only the fields
you want to change. Apply reads the other preferences at that moment and preserves
them.

| Optional field | Type and allowed values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zoom_percent` | Integer, 80 through 150 inclusive. | App zoom percentage. |
| `sidebar_width` | Integer, 190 through 360 inclusive. | Channel/conversation sidebar width in logical pixels, before display scaling. |
| `show_members` | Boolean. | Keep the People/member list open in wide windows. |
| `animate_gifs` | Boolean. | Allow visible chat GIFs to animate automatically. |
| `hide_media_links` | Boolean. | Hide standalone image/GIF links when their preview is shown. |
| `smooth_scrolling` | Boolean. | Animate scrolling. |
| `scroll_speed_percent` | Integer, 25 through 300 inclusive. | Scroll speed percentage; 100 is normal. |

```json
{
  "effects": [{
    "type": "set_local_settings",
    "settings": {"zoom_percent": 110, "animate_gifs": false, "smooth_scrolling": true, "scroll_speed_percent": 125}
  }]
}
```

An omitted or `null` patch field means unchanged. At least one field must contain
a value: `{}` or an all-null patch is invalid. `false` is a real boolean change,
not an omitted value. A value equal to the current preference is allowed.
Unknown fields and out-of-range values are rejected. Other preferences, including
external-link confirmation, are outside this patch.

### Change device-local notification settings

`set_notification_settings` / `HostEffect::SetNotificationSettings` requires the
separate `notification_settings` capability. Its required `settings` object is a
`NotificationSettingsPatch`. Every field in
[`NotificationSettingsSnapshot`](extension-sdk-reference.md#notificationsettingssnapshot-device-local-notifications)
has a matching optional patch field: `Option<bool>` for the fourteen toggles and
`Option<u8>` for `volume` (0 through 100 inclusive). JSON uses booleans and an
integer respectively. `disable_sounds` is the master switch; it does not overwrite
individual cue toggles. Zero volume also silences sounds.

These are local preferences saved through the app's ordinary device-preference
path. This action does not update Discord account/server/channel notification
settings, play a sound, start a call or change microphone/camera state.

As with reading settings, omitted or `null` fields preserve their **Apply-time**
values, and at least one field must have a value. Empty/all-null patches, unknown
fields and out-of-range values are rejected without applying any part of the
patch. Foreground `message`, `composer` and `panel` actions may propose one effect;
background activation/message/app events cannot change settings. The result shows
the proposed values and requires **Apply**, which rechecks the plugin, grant and
account/conversation context. Closing the result makes no change.

#### Complete notification interaction

Declare a `panel` action named `quiet` and request `notification_settings` in the
manifest. This synthetic input supplies all fields of the current snapshot:

```json
{
  "action": "quiet",
  "values": {},
  "app": {
    "notification_settings": {
      "new_message": true,
      "current_channel": false,
      "incoming_ring": true,
      "outgoing_ring": true,
      "disable_sounds": false,
      "unread_badge": true,
      "mute": true,
      "unmute": true,
      "deafen": true,
      "undeafen": true,
      "camera_on": true,
      "screen_share_on": true,
      "user_join": true,
      "user_leave": true,
      "volume": 75
    }
  }
}
```

This complete SDK handler proposes silencing sounds only when the snapshot is
available and sounds are currently enabled. It preserves the volume and every
individual cue choice.

```rust
use serein_extension_sdk::{
    AppInvocation, AppOutput, HostEffect, NotificationSettingsPatch,
};

fn handle(input: AppInvocation) -> AppOutput {
    if input.app_event.is_some() || input.message_event.is_some()
        || input.invocation.action != "quiet"
    {
        return AppOutput::default();
    }
    let Some(settings) = input.app.as_ref()
        .and_then(|app| app.notification_settings.as_ref())
    else {
        return AppOutput::default();
    };
    if settings.disable_sounds {
        return AppOutput::default();
    }
    AppOutput {
        effects: vec![HostEffect::SetNotificationSettings {
            settings: NotificationSettingsPatch {
                disable_sounds: Some(true),
                ..Default::default()
            },
        }],
        ..Default::default()
    }
}

serein_extension_sdk::export!(handle);
```

For the input above, the effect is:

```json
{
  "effects": [{
    "type": "set_notification_settings",
    "settings": {"disable_sounds": true}
  }]
}
```

The host displays the proposal; returning this JSON alone changes nothing.
After Apply, the current local sound preferences use the master disable while
other values remain unchanged. Plugins observing `settings` events receive a
fresh notification snapshot only with the matching grant. An older host rejects
a manifest requesting `notification_settings`; support discovery cannot bypass
that install-time check.

## Panels and storage

A panel is a list of native controls returned by your handler. tesktop2 renders
those controls; the plugin does not run while they are drawn. Editing a field
changes the panel's local form values. A **panel button** runs another declared
action with those values. It does not automatically approve a host action that
the next result proposes.

### The nine element types

Every element is a JSON object with a `type` tag. Supply every field listed in
the middle column. The same names are fields of the corresponding Rust `Element`
variant; unknown fields are rejected by the host.

| JSON `type` / Rust variant | Fields | Display or input behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` / `Text` | `text`: string, at most 4 KiB. | Plain wrapping text. It may be empty or contain newlines; it is not HTML or executable markup. |
| `heading` / `Heading` | `text`: nonempty string, at most 128 bytes, no control characters. | A native heading. |
| `separator` / `Separator` | None. | A visual divider. |
| `row` / `Row` | `children`: array of elements. | Places children in a horizontal row that wraps when needed. |
| `button` / `Button` | `id`: action ID; `label`: display text. | Invokes the manifest's `panel` action with this exact ID. |
| `text_input` / `TextInput` | `id`, `label`, `value`: initial string, at most 4 KiB. | A single-line text field. The native editor limits typing to 1,024 characters; submitted values also have the 4 KiB byte limit. |
| `checkbox` / `Checkbox` | `id`, `label`, `checked`: initial boolean. | Returns the string `"true"` or `"false"`. |
| `select` / `Select` | `id`, `label`, `options`: string array; `value`: initial selected string. | A dropdown. `value` must exactly match one option. |
| `slider` / `Slider` | `id`, `label`, `min`, `max`, `value`: signed 32-bit integers. | An integer slider with `min < max` and an initial value in the inclusive range. Returns a decimal string. |

Control labels are nonempty, at most 128 UTF-8 bytes, and contain no control
characters. Dropdowns have 1 through 32 unique nonempty options, each at most
128 bytes without control characters. A label is what the user sees; an ID is
what your code uses.

### IDs and panel limits

Give every button and input a unique ID across the **whole panel**, including
nested rows. A button cannot reuse an input ID. IDs contain lowercase ASCII
letters, digits and hyphens, begin with a letter or digit, and are at most 64
bytes. Windows device names such as `con`, `nul`, `com1` and `lpt1` are reserved.
Spaces, underscores and uppercase letters are not allowed.

A button ID must also name a manifest action with `"surface": "panel"`.
Input IDs do not need manifest actions. A plugin may declare at most 16 actions.
Panels contain at most 64 elements in total, including rows and their children,
with at most eight nested row levels. The full result still shares the 256 KiB
serialized output budget. Byte limits count UTF-8 bytes, not visible letters.

### How a button receives form values

1. A user opens a foreground action, and its output supplies a panel.
2. tesktop2 initializes each input from `value` or `checked` and keeps edits locally.
   Typing, selecting, dragging and checking do not call your handler.
3. Clicking a button creates a fresh invocation whose `action` is the button ID.
   Input IDs become keys in `values`; all values are strings. The button itself
   does not add a value.
4. The worker loads the latest granted storage and runs a fresh Wasm instance.
   Panel callbacks have no previous `selected_message` or `composer` text.
   App-aware callbacks receive a freshly rebuilt, separately granted snapshot.
5. The next output replaces the displayed result and initializes its new form.
   Storage and appearance can take effect immediately; an `effects` proposal
   still waits for the host's Apply button.

For example, checking `enabled` and setting `limit` to 4 before clicking `save`
produces an invocation like this (storage and other granted fields may be added):

```json
{"action":"save","values":{"enabled":"true","limit":"4"}}
```

Use `input.value("name")` to read `Option<&str>` without allocating. Use
`input.parse_value::<bool>("enabled")` or `input.parse_value::<i32>("limit")`
for typed inputs. `Ok(None)` means the ID was absent; `Ok(Some(value))` means
parsing succeeded; `Err(_)` means malformed text. Boolean parsing accepts
`"true"` and `"false"`, not `"1"`, `"yes"` or an empty string. Integer parsing
does not enforce your slider range: check it in the handler too.

The invocation allows at most 64 form entries, each with a valid ID and at most
4 KiB of string data, within the shared 256 KiB input budget. Treat missing and
invalid values explicitly; do not silently turn either into a saved preference.

### Storage is one value, not a filesystem

The `storage` capability gives this plugin one opaque UTF-8 string for the
current account. Each non-null `output.storage` replaces the **whole** saved
value. Omit it to leave storage alone. To store multiple settings, encode one
JSON object yourself; tesktop2 does not merge object fields for you.

For example, this is a complete output that saves a JSON object inside the
storage string:

```json
{"storage":"{\"enabled\":true,\"limit\":4}"}
```

`input.storage_json::<T>()` returns `Ok(None)` if there is no saved value,
`Ok(Some(value))` for valid JSON of type `T`, and `Err(_)` for invalid or
incompatible JSON. An empty stored string is an error, not missing storage.
`output.set_storage_json(&value)` serializes into the same string field. If
serialization fails, it leaves that output field unchanged; it does not itself
write to disk. The host writes it only after accepting the complete result.

Save from foreground actions or separately granted message/app event handlers.
Activation receives saved storage for restoring settings, but this build ignores
storage returned from activation. It also does not display an activation panel.
An ordinary panel action is the appropriate place for a settings editor.

The disk ceiling is 1 MiB per plugin, but storage also travels through the
256 KiB invocation/output buffers alongside other fields. Nested JSON escaping
counts toward that smaller practical limit; keep settings small. Each call gets
a fresh instance, so globals are not persistent storage. Disabling or logging out
clears the account's extension data; cleanup failures are reported and retried.
Re-enabling starts fresh. Storage
is ordinary local data, not encrypted secret storage; never put credentials in it.

### Complete settings panel and Save handler

This example stores **plugin preferences**, not tesktop2's reading settings. It
requests only `storage`; changing the app's reading preferences instead requires
a `local_settings` host proposal and Apply.

Use this complete manifest:

```json
{
  "api_version": 1,
  "id": "panel-settings",
  "name": "Panel Settings Example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Example Author",
  "license": "MIT",
  "source": "https://example.com/panel-settings",
  "kind": "plugin",
  "capabilities": ["storage"],
  "actions": [
    {"id":"show","label":"Open plugin settings","surface":"panel"},
    {"id":"save","label":"Save plugin settings","surface":"panel"}
  ]
}
```

In a copied example workspace, add the plugin as a workspace member and use this
`Cargo.toml`. The parent workspace already defines these two dependencies.

```toml
[package]
name = "panel-settings"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2024"
publish = false

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
serde.workspace = true
serein-extension-sdk.workspace = true
```

Put this complete handler in `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use serein_extension_sdk::{Element, Invocation, Output};

#[derive(Default, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct Settings {
    enabled: bool,
    limit: i32,
}

fn note(text: &str) -> Output {
    Output {
        panel: vec![Element::Text { text: text.into() }],
        ..Default::default()
    }
}

fn form(settings: &Settings) -> Output {
    Output {
        panel: vec![
            Element::Checkbox {
                id: "enabled".into(), label: "Enable summaries".into(),
                checked: settings.enabled,
            },
            Element::Slider {
                id: "limit".into(), label: "Maximum items".into(),
                min: 0, max: 10, value: settings.limit,
            },
            Element::Button { id: "save".into(), label: "Save preferences".into() },
        ],
        ..Default::default()
    }
}

fn handle(input: Invocation) -> Output {
    match input.action.as_str() {
        "show" => {
            let settings = match input.storage_json::<Settings>() {
                Ok(None) => Settings::default(),
                Ok(Some(value)) if (0..=10).contains(&value.limit) => value,
                _ => return note("Saved preferences are invalid; nothing was overwritten."),
            };
            form(&settings)
        }
        "save" => {
            let enabled = match input.parse_value::<bool>("enabled") {
                Ok(Some(value)) => value,
                _ => return note("Choose whether summaries are enabled."),
            };
            let limit = match input.parse_value::<i32>("limit") {
                Ok(Some(value)) if (0..=10).contains(&value) => value,
                _ => return note("Choose a maximum from 0 through 10."),
            };
            let settings = Settings { enabled, limit };
            let mut output = form(&settings);
            if output.set_storage_json(&settings).is_err() {
                return note("Preferences could not be encoded; nothing was saved.");
            }
            output.panel.push(Element::Text { text: "Preferences saved.".into() });
            output
        }
        _ => Output::default(),
    }
}

serein_extension_sdk::export!(handle);
```

Open **Open plugin settings**, edit the controls, then click **Save preferences**.
The save action returns both the updated form and its new storage string. The
host commits storage before presenting the returned success text; there is no
extra Apply step for plugin storage. Opening the manifest's save action directly
without form values shows a validation message instead of changing storage.
Invalid saved data is reported on open, without an automatic reset or overwrite.

Use the [local development commands](../examples/extensions/README.md#test-and-develop-locally)
to test your copied example. Because adding a workspace member changes the
lockfile, first run `cargo check -p panel-settings` from `examples/extensions/`
in your development copy. Review and commit the updated `Cargo.lock`, then build
and package this plugin from the same directory:

```powershell
cargo build --locked --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p panel-settings
python pack.py panel-settings/manifest.json target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/panel_settings.wasm packages/panel-settings.tesktop2-extension
```

proposals, read [App Toolbox](../examples/extensions/app-toolbox/src/lib.rs).
