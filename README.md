# tesktop-rust

**tesktop2** is the Tesktop/TestCord distribution of the native Serein client, and this
repository is its home. The native Rust/egui/wgpu UI and networking runtime are based on
[Serein](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/Serein); Tesktop features are layered on top without
replacing that client. Serein remains the upstream project and is used under its original
MIT/Apache-2.0 terms.

TestCord plugins are ported natively here rather than injected into a web client; see
[docs/testcord-plugins.md](docs/testcord-plugins.md) for the contract, the bounds, the ports
that ship today and what is deliberately left out.

> [!WARNING]
> **Unofficial and not endorsed by Discord.**
> Serein communicates directly with Discord's public gateway and REST endpoints for your existing account. Automating normal accounts outside the official OAuth2/bot API violates Discord's Terms of Service and carries risk of account termination. Technical interoperability does not imply platform approval. Review the [compatibility matrix](docs/discord-compatibility.md) and [authentication guide](docs/authentication.md) before use.

---

<details open>
<summary><h3>🐧 Linux (Flatpak, Repositories, Gentoo, AppImage)</h3></summary>

#### 1. Flatpak (Recommended)

Flatpak is the recommended distribution format for Linux, featuring sandbox isolation, bundled GNOME/WebKit runtimes, and automatic background updates.

- **One-Click Repository Install (Automatic Updates)**:
  ```sh
  flatpak install --user https://viceverse-cz.github.io/Serein/flatpak/serein.flatpakref
  ```
  Once installed, your desktop software store (GNOME Software, KDE Discover) or `flatpak update` will automatically discover and install updates.

- **Standalone Offline Bundle**:
  Download `Serein-linux.flatpak` from [Releases](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/rustcord/releases):
  ```sh
  flatpak install --user ./Serein-linux.flatpak
  flatpak run cz.viceverse.serein
  ```

See [Flatpak guide](packaging/flatpak/README.md) for sandbox permissions and source build details.

#### 2. Native Package Repositories (apt, dnf, zypper, pacman)

Configure the signed package repository for your distribution with one command:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://viceverse-cz.github.io/Serein/setup.sh | sh
```
The script detects your distribution (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux), cryptographically verifies the GPG signing key, and configures the repository with an option to install immediately.

After setup, manage Serein with your native package manager:
```sh
# Ubuntu / Debian: sudo apt install serein
# Fedora:          sudo dnf install serein
# openSUSE:        sudo zypper install serein
# Arch Linux:      sudo pacman -S serein
```
Your normal system updates (`apt upgrade`, `dnf upgrade`, `zypper update`, `pacman -Syu`) will keep Serein updated. See [Signed package repositories](packaging/repositories/README.md) for manual GPG verification steps.

#### 3. Gentoo (source or binary)

Gentoo users can install Serein from the [vitaly-zdanevich-overlay](https://github.com/vitaly-zdanevich/gentoo-overlay) overlay. It provides a source ebuild ([net-im/serein](https://github.com/vitaly-zdanevich/gentoo-overlay/tree/main/net-im/serein)) and a prebuilt amd64 ebuild ([net-im/serein-bin](https://github.com/vitaly-zdanevich/gentoo-overlay/tree/main/net-im/serein-bin)).

```sh
sudo eselect repository add vitaly-zdanevich-overlay git https://github.com/vitaly-zdanevich/gentoo-overlay.git
sudo emaint sync -r vitaly-zdanevich-overlay
echo 'net-im/serein ~amd64' | sudo tee /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/serein
sudo emerge --ask net-im/serein
```

Use `net-im/serein-bin` in the keyword file and emerge command to install the prebuilt binary instead. The source ebuild requires Rust 1.98.1 or newer. The binary ebuild targets amd64 systems with glibc 2.43 or newer. The two ebuilds install the same files, so choose one.

#### 4. Standalone AppImage (Portable)

Download `serein-<version>-Linux-X64.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/rustcord/releases), make it executable, and run:
```sh
chmod +x ./serein-*-Linux-X64.AppImage
./serein-*-Linux-X64.AppImage
```
Keep the AppImage in a writable directory to receive in-app updates via **Settings → Updates**. Note that the tesktop2 Linux build uses host GTK 3 and WebKit2GTK 4.1 libraries; see [AppImage setup and runtime dependencies](packaging/appimage/README.md) for host requirements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🪟 Windows (Installer, PowerShell, Portable)</h3></summary>

#### 1. Setup Installer (Recommended)
Download the `Windows-X64-Setup.exe` or `Windows-ARM64-Setup.exe` asset for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/rustcord/releases) and run it:
- Installs per-user to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Serein` without requiring administrator/UAC elevation.
- Automatically registers Start Menu shortcuts and configures AppUserModelID (`cz.viceverse.serein`) for native Windows toast notifications.
- Registers in Windows Settings (Installed Apps / Add or Remove Programs) with full uninstall support.
- Fully compatible with in-app self-updates: updates automatically synchronize the registered version.

#### 2. Standalone PowerShell Setup
Extract the `Windows-X64.zip` or `Windows-ARM64.zip` asset for your system and run:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1
```
To uninstall later:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1 -Uninstall
```

#### 3. Portable Archive
Extract the `Windows-X64.zip` or `Windows-ARM64.zip` asset for your system anywhere and launch `serein.exe`. To enable native desktop notifications:
```powershell
powershell -File .\install-notifications.ps1
```
Run the script from the extracted folder beside `serein.exe`. If PowerShell's `RemoteSigned` policy blocks the downloaded script, review it and run `Unblock-File -LiteralPath .\install-notifications.ps1` in that folder before retrying. The Windows installer registers the shortcut automatically, so installed builds do not need this script.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🍎 macOS (Homebrew Cask, Standalone .app)</h3></summary>

#### Homebrew Cask
```sh
brew tap ViceVerse-cz/serein https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/Serein.git
brew install --cask serein
```
The explicit repository URL keeps the cask in this repository; a separate `homebrew-serein` tap is not required.

#### Standalone Bundle
Download `serein-<version>-macOS-ARM64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/rustcord/releases), unzip, and drag `Serein.app` to your `/Applications` folder.

</details>

## Highlights

- ⚡ **Pure Native Performance:** Built with pure Rust, `egui`, and `wgpu`. Immediate-mode rendering with minimal idle CPU, low memory footprint, and instantaneous launch times—zero Electron, Node.js, or web runtime overhead.
- 🌐 **Direct Gateway & REST Transports:** Direct connection to Discord's official endpoints with active rate-limiting cooldowns, heartbeat handling, reconnect/resume loops, and partial payload patching.
- 🔒 **Secure OS Credential Storage:** Session tokens are stored exclusively in your operating system's secure vault (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service). Never saved in plaintext.
- 🛡️ **Ephemeral Authentication Webview:** Sign-in uses Discord's official hosted login page inside a temporary native webview (WKWebView, WebView2, or WebKitGTK) supporting email/password, QR login, and MFA. An origin-checked handoff secures the session credential and immediately terminates the webview.
- 💾 **Bounded Local Persistence:** Recent chat history, drafts, image previews, settings, and diagnostics are stored in an account-isolated, bounded local SQLite database. All local data is strictly cleared upon explicit logout.
- 🎙️ **Voice Calls, Video & Screen Sharing:** Native voice engine with 1-to-1 and group DM calls, server voice channels, push-to-talk and DAVE v1 end-to-end encryption. Microphone capture requires native 96 kHz stereo input and keeps both channels without app-side resampling, suppression, echo cancellation, automatic gain or voice gating. Opus 1.6 QEXT targets about 540 kbps within the bounded UDP budget; this experimental mode is not verified against Discord, whose published voice guidance specifies 48 kHz stereo. Opus remains lossy, and 192 kHz is not an accepted libopus encoder rate. Includes native screen capture (macOS ScreenCaptureKit, Windows Graphics Capture, Linux portal/PipeWire with VA-API/NVENC hardware encoding and software fallback; Linux native capture remains unverified) and incoming stream & camera video playback with hardware-accelerated decoding (VideoToolbox, VA-API, DirectX).
- 🧵 **Forum Channels & Active Threads:** Browse forum channels, view posts sorted by recent activity, read message threads with unread indicators, and create new forum posts directly in-app.
- ⚙️ **Server Administration Suite:** Full server management interface including Server Profiles (banners, icons, traits, descriptions), custom sticker management, role editor with fine-grained permission matrix, paginated audit logs with action filters, invite manager with revocation, integrations and webhooks, and member moderation.
- ✨ **GIF & Twemoji Picker:** Instant KLIPY GIF search with favorites and one-click sending, full Twemoji picker with search and quick-reactions, plus custom guild emojis.
- 📎 **Multi-Attachment Batch Uploads:** Composer staging tray supporting multiple files of any type (PDF, ZIP, 3D STL, videos, audio, images) with file-type badges, thumbnails, size indicators, individual removal, and progress tracking.
- 👤 **Native Profile Customization:** In-app profile editor for global display names, bios / about me, pronouns, and custom accent colors with real-time live preview cards.
- 🎨 **Extensions & Theme Shop:** Git-backed plugin engine and community theme shop with preview cards, color preset toggles, permission verification, and a built-in deleted-message retention protector.
- 🎬 **Rich Media & Video Player:** Inline video playback for MOV and MP4 attachments, interactive seekable voice message waveforms, right-click media save/copy context menus, and full-resolution image viewer modals.
- ⌨️ **Keybinds & Shortcuts:** Built-in keybind reference sheet styled with raised keycaps, quick edit (`Up`), quick delete (`Backspace`), and intuitive keyboard navigation.
- 🎮 **Rich Presence & Game Detection:** Built-in Discord IPC and WebSocket RPC servers, plus executable-based detection of running games, showing live game activities in member rosters, DM lists, and user profiles, with opt-in system tray integration.

## Security & Storage Policy

- **Token Protection:** Tokens are saved solely in the native OS credential store (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service). Plaintext token fallback is strictly prohibited. Active tokens remain redacted in memory.
- **Local Cache Bounds:** SQLite databases store recent channel history, drafts, settings, diagnostics, and image preview metadata within bounded byte and count limits. The local SQLite store is **not** encrypted by the application.
- **Sanitary Logout:** Executing an explicit logout destroys active network sessions, purges active secrets from memory, deletes the token from the OS credential store, and erases that account's local cache and drafts.
- **Zero Telemetry:** Serein contains no analytics, telemetry, background crash collectors, or tracking beacons.
- **Platform Integrity:** No fingerprint spoofing, CAPTCHA/MFA bypasses, bot substitutions, token scrapers, or third-party relays.

For full details, review the [Storage Policy](docs/storage-policy.md) and [Threat Model](docs/threat-model.md).

## License

Original Serein code is dual-licensed under either:
- **MIT License** ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT))
- **Apache License, Version 2.0** ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE))

at your option. Third-party library notices, bundled font licenses (Inter, Noto Sans CJK/Arabic), and Twemoji graphics licenses are cataloged in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Demo fixtures and simulated actions are excluded from normal app and CI packages.
Build with `--features demo` and launch with `--demo` to enable them; `--demo-*`
scenario flags additionally require `--demo`. `cargo xtask package` always builds
without demo support, while offline tests can still use synthetic fixtures.
